 </div>
<h2 id="1-substance-abuse-and-addiction">1. Substance Abuse and Addiction</h2>
<p>Substance abuse and addiction can have a detrimental impact on a parent's ability to provide a safe and stable environment for their child. If a parent has a history of drug or alcohol abuse, it can raise serious concerns about their ability to meet the child's needs and ensure their safety. The court may order drug or alcohol testing and may require the parent to complete a treatment program before considering granting custody or visitation rights.</p>
<h2 id="2-domestic-violence">2. Domestic Violence</h2>
<p>Domestic violence is a grave issue that can have severe consequences for child custody cases. If a parent has a history of domestic violence, whether it is directed towards the child or the other parent, the court will prioritize the safety and well-being of the child above all else.<a href="/san-diego-domestic-violence-lawyer/">Domestic violence</a> can result in the loss of custody rights and may require supervised visitation or the completion of anger management programs before any custody or visitation rights are granted.</p>
<h2 id="3-neglect-or-abuse">3. Neglect or Abuse</h2>
<p>Child neglect or abuse is a clear indication that a parent is not providing a safe and nurturing environment for their child. Neglect can take many forms, such as failure to provide proper healthcare, education, or emotional support. Physical, emotional, or sexual abuse towards the child will almost certainly result in the loss of custody rights. The court's primary concern is the safety and welfare of the child, and any evidence of neglect or abuse will be taken very seriously.</p>
<h2 id="4-parental-alienation">4. Parental Alienation</h2>
<p>Parental alienation occurs when one parent actively undermines the child's relationship with the other parent. This can involve speaking negatively about the other parent, interfering with visitation schedules, or manipulating the child to align with their own feelings towards the other parent. Parental alienation is detrimental to the child's emotional well-being and can result in the loss of custody or visitation rights for the alienating parent.</p>
<h2 id="5-failure-to-comply-with-court-orders">5. Failure to Comply with Court Orders</h2>
<p>Court orders related to child custody, visitation, and support must be followed diligently. If a parent consistently fails to comply with court orders or shows a pattern of non-compliance, it can be viewed as a disregard for the court's authority and the child's best interests. Failure to comply with court orders can lead to a loss of custody or visitation rights and may result in fines, contempt charges, or even imprisonment.</p>
<h2 id="6-relocation-without-court-approval">6. Relocation without Court Approval</h2>
<p>In California, a parent who wishes to <a href="/san-diego-move-away-child-relocation-lawyer/">relocate with their child</a> must obtain court approval. Relocation without court approval can be viewed as a violation of the other parent's rights and can disrupt the child's established routine and relationship with the non-relocating parent. If a parent relocates without court approval, it can significantly impact their custody rights and may result in a modification of the custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="7-parental-unfitness">7. Parental Unfitness</h2>
<p>The court may determine that a parent is unfit to have custody of their child if they are unable to meet the child's physical, emotional, or developmental needs. This could be due to mental illness, physical incapacity, or other factors that prevent the parent from providing a stable and nurturing environment. If a parent is deemed unfit, the court may award sole custody to the other parent or a third party.</p>
<h2 id="8-criminal-convictions">8. Criminal Convictions</h2>
<p>Serious criminal convictions can have a significant impact on child custody cases. Crimes such as domestic violence, child abuse, <a href="https://www.sevenslegal.com/san-diego-drug-lawyer/">drug offenses</a>, or any offense that poses a danger to the child can result in the loss of custody rights. The court will prioritize the safety and well-being of the child above all else and may require the convicted parent to complete rehabilitation programs or demonstrate significant rehabilitation before considering custody or visitation rights.</p>
<p>It is important to note that each child custody case is unique, and the court will consider all relevant factors before making a decision. The court's primary concern is the best interests of the child, and any evidence or circumstances that demonstrate a potential risk to the child's safety or well-being will be taken into account.</p>
<p>If you are facing a child custody battle in California, it is crucial to seek the guidance of an experienced family law attorney. They can help you navigate the complexities of the legal system, advocate for your rights, and ensure the best possible outcome for you and your child.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>
<h3 id="overview-of-divorce-in-california">Overview of Divorce in California</h3>
<p>Divorce in California is governed by the laws and regulations of the state's judicial system. One key aspect of divorce in California is that it follows a no-fault divorce system. This means that neither spouse is required to prove wrongdoing or assign blame for the breakdown of the marriage.</p>
<p>In California, you can file for divorce or legal separation to end a marriage or domestic partnership. A legal separation has a similar process to divorce, but the couple remains legally married or in a domestic partnership. Alternatively, an annulment declares the marriage or domestic partnership null and void, as if it never existed.</p>
<h2 id="2-residency-requirements"><strong>2. Residency Requirements</strong></h2>
<h3 id="establishing-residency-in-california">Establishing Residency in California</h3>
<p>To file for divorce in California, either you or your spouse must have lived in the state for at least six months and in your current county for the past three months. These residency requirements apply to both divorce and legal separation cases.</p>
<p>For same-sex couples who married in California but now reside in a state that doesn't recognize same-sex divorce, they can file for divorce in the county where they got married. However, the court may have limitations on making decisions regarding property, support, or children. Consulting with a lawyer is advisable in such situations.</p>
<h3 id="residency-rules-for-legal-separation-same-sex-couples-and-domestic-partners">Residency Rules for Legal Separation, Same-Sex Couples, and Domestic Partners</h3>
<p>If you are seeking a legal separation, you can file as soon as one of you moves to California. If either spouse decides to convert the legal separation into a divorce, they can do so once they have met the residency requirements.</p>
<p>For registered domestic partnerships in California, the residency requirement may not apply if the partnership is registered within the state. However, if the domestic partnership is not registered in California, the residency requirement must be met.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about your eligibility or have questions about the residency requirements, it is recommended to consult with a family law attorney.</p>
<h2 id="3-filing-for-divorce"><strong>3. Filing for Divorce</strong></h2>
<h3 id="initiating-the-divorce-process">Initiating the Divorce Process</h3>
<p>To begin the <a href="/divorce-process/">divorce process in California</a>, you need to file certain forms with the court. These forms can be obtained from the court's website or the courthouse itself. It is essential to ensure that you use the correct forms and provide accurate information to avoid delays or complications.</p>
<p>When filing for divorce, you will need to pay a fee. As of [2023], the fee ranges from $435 to $450. However, if you are unable to afford the fee, you may be eligible for a fee waiver. It is crucial to review the court's guidelines and requirements for obtaining a fee waiver if you believe you qualify.</p>
<h3 id="court-forms-and-fee-waivers">Court Forms and Fee Waivers</h3>
<p>Completing the necessary court forms correctly is crucial for a smooth divorce process. The forms typically include a petition for divorce, summons, and various declarations and disclosures related to marital assets, debts, and child custody.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the specific forms and requirements may vary depending on your county and individual circumstances. Therefore, it is recommended to consult your local court or a family law attorney to ensure you have the correct forms and understand the process fully.</p>
<h2 id="4-serving-court-papers"><strong>4. Serving Court Papers</strong></h2>
<h3 id="officially-notifying-your-spouse">Officially Notifying Your Spouse</h3>
<p>After you have filed the necessary documents with the court, you must serve the papers to your spouse. &quot;Serving court papers&quot; means officially notifying your spouse that you have initiated a divorce or legal separation case. This step ensures that your spouse is aware of the proceedings and has the opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>Proper service of court papers is essential to ensure the validity and integrity of the legal process. It is advisable to consult the California Rules of Court or seek legal advice to understand the specific requirements for serving court papers in your case.</p>
<h2 id="5-financial-disclosure"><strong>5. Financial Disclosure</strong></h2>
<h3 id="sharing-financial-information">Sharing Financial Information</h3>
<p>As part of the divorce process in California, both spouses are required to disclose their financial information. This includes assets, debts, income, expenses, and other relevant financial details. Full and accurate financial disclosure is crucial for the court to make fair and informed decisions regarding property division, spousal support, and child support.</p>
<p>Failure to provide complete and honest financial disclosure can have serious consequences, including potential penalties or the reopening of the case. It is essential to gather and organize all relevant financial documents and consult with a family law attorney to ensure compliance with the court's requirements.</p>
<h3 id="division-of-property-and-debts">Division of Property and Debts</h3>
<p>In California, community property laws govern the division of assets and debts acquired during the marriage or domestic partnership. Community property is generally divided equally between the spouses, although certain exceptions exist.</p>
<p>When dividing property and debts, the court considers factors such as the length of the marriage, each spouse's financial situation, contributions to the marriage, and other relevant factors. It is important to note that separate property, which includes assets owned before marriage or acquired through inheritance or gifts, is generally not subject to division.</p>
<h3 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h3>
<p>Spousal support, also known as alimony, is the financial assistance provided by one spouse to the other after a divorce or legal separation. The court may order temporary or long-term spousal support based on various factors, including the length of the marriage, each spouse's income and earning capacity, and the standard of living during the marriage.</p>
<p>Spousal support can be a complex issue, and the court has discretion in determining the amount and duration of support. Consulting with a family law attorney can help ensure that your rights and interests are protected regarding spousal support matters.</p>
<h2 id="6-child-custody-and-support"><strong>6. Child Custody and Support</strong></h2>
<h3 id="determining-child-custody">Determining Child Custody</h3>
<p>Child custody is often one of the most significant concerns for divorcing parents. In California, the court encourages parents to reach a mutually agreed-upon parenting plan that serves the best interests of the child. If the parents cannot agree, the court will make custody decisions based on the child's best interests.</p>
<p>The court considers various factors when <a href="/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">determining child custody</a>, including the child's age, health, and relationship with each parent, as well as each parent's ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment. It is crucial to prioritize the child's well-being and work towards a custody arrangement that promotes their physical and emotional development.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-parenting-plan">Creating a Parenting Plan</h3>
<p>A parenting plan outlines the custody and visitation schedule for the child, as well as other important aspects such as decision-making authority and communication between the parents. It is generally in the child's best interests for parents to develop a comprehensive parenting plan that addresses their unique needs and circumstances.</p>
<p>Working with a mediator or a family law attorney can help facilitate productive discussions and negotiations to create a parenting plan that meets the child's needs and ensures both parents have a meaningful and active role in their upbringing.</p>
<h3 id="calculating-child-support">Calculating Child Support</h3>
<p>Child support is a financial obligation that one parent may be required to pay to the other parent to help cover the costs of raising the child. In California, child support is determined based on state guidelines, which take into account factors such as each parent's income, the amount of time the child spends with each parent, and other relevant factors.</p>
<p>The court uses a formula to <a href="/san-diego-child-support-lawyer/">calculate child support</a>, considering the income of both parents and the number of children involved. It is important to ensure that accurate income information is provided to the court to arrive at a fair and appropriate child support order.</p>
<h2 id="7-agreements-and-mediation"><strong>7. Agreements and Mediation</strong></h2>
<h3 id="reaching-an-agreement-with-your-spouse">Reaching an Agreement with Your Spouse</h3>
<p>Divorce proceedings can be emotionally and financially draining. Whenever possible, reaching a mutual agreement with your spouse can help streamline the process and minimize conflicts. Collaborative divorce, negotiation, or mediation are methods that couples can explore to work together and find common ground.</p>
<p>In mediation, a neutral third party, known as a mediator, helps facilitate discussions and negotiations between the spouses. Mediation allows couples to maintain control over the decision-making process and promotes open communication and cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="mediation-and-alternative-dispute-resolution">Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Mediation and alternative dispute resolution methods can help couples resolve issues such as child custody, visitation, property division, and support without resorting to lengthy court battles. These methods can be more cost-effective and less adversarial, allowing both parties to actively participate in finding solutions that work for their unique circumstances.</p>
<p>Working with a skilled mediator or family law attorney experienced in mediation can help ensure that your rights and interests are protected throughout the negotiation process.</p>
<h2 id="8-finalizing-the-divorce"><strong>8. Finalizing the Divorce</strong></h2>
<h3 id="waiting-period-and-finalizing-the-divorce">Waiting Period and Finalizing the Divorce</h3>
<p>In California, there is a waiting period before a divorce can be finalized. By law, a divorce cannot be finalized until at least six months have passed since the date the divorce papers were served to the other spouse. This waiting period allows couples to reconsider their decision and possibly reconcile.</p>
<p>Once the waiting period has passed, the final step in the divorce process is to submit the required final paperwork to the court. This paperwork typically includes a judgment of dissolution of marriage or domestic partnership, which legally terminates the marriage or partnership.</p>
<h2 id="9-getting-legal-help"><strong>9. Getting Legal Help</strong></h2>
<h3 id="self-help-resources">Self-Help Resources</h3>
<p>Navigating the divorce process in California can be challenging, and it is essential to have access to reliable information and resources. <a href="https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/court-based-self-help-services">The California Courts' website provides self-help guides, court forms, and instructions to assist individuals representing themselves in divorce cases</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, many local courts have self-help centers where trained staff can provide guidance on court procedures, forms, and other divorce-related matters. Utilizing these resources can help ensure that you have the necessary information to proceed with your case.</p>
<h3 id="hiring-a-divorce-attorney">Hiring a Divorce Attorney</h3>
<p>While it is possible to navigate the divorce process without legal representation, consulting with a divorce attorney can provide you with invaluable support and guidance. A skilled attorney can help you understand your rights, advocate for your interests, and ensure that all legal requirements are met.</p>
<p>If you have complex financial issues, child custody disputes, or concerns about your legal rights, hiring a divorce attorney is highly recommended. They can provide personalized advice and represent your best interests throughout the divorce process.</p>
<h2 id="10-conclusion"><strong>10. Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Divorce in California can be a challenging and emotional process, but with the right information and resources, you can navigate it successfully. This comprehensive guide has provided you with an overview of the divorce process, residency requirements, filing procedures, financial disclosure, child custody and support, agreements and mediation, finalizing the divorce, and the importance of legal assistance.</p>
<p>Remember, divorce is a significant life event, and seeking support from professionals, such as family law attorneys and mediators, can help ensure that your rights and interests are protected.

<p>In California, the court takes into account several factors when deciding <a href="/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">child custody arrangements</a>. These factors include the child&rsquo;s age, health, and emotional well-being, as well as the ability of each parent to provide a stable and safe environment. The court also considers the child&rsquo;s relationship with each parent and any history of <a href="https://calbizjournal.com/how-does-domestic-violence-affect-divorce-in-california/">domestic violence</a> or substance abuse.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-a-dui-on-child-custody-cases">The Impact of a DUI on Child Custody Cases</h2>
<p>A DUI conviction can have a significant impact on a child custody case in California. Courts prioritize the safety and well-being of the child, and a DUI conviction raises concerns about a parent&rsquo;s ability to provide a safe environment. It can be seen as evidence of reckless behavior and a lack of judgment, which may lead to doubts about the parent&rsquo;s ability to make responsible decisions regarding the child&rsquo;s welfare.</p>
<p>A DUI conviction can also affect the parent&rsquo;s credibility and reputation in the eyes of the court. It may be used as evidence of a pattern of behavior that could potentially endanger the child. The court may view a DUI as an indication of a substance abuse problem, which can further jeopardize a parent&rsquo;s chances of obtaining custody or visitation rights.</p>

Understanding the Legalities and Emotional Considerations</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Divorce can be a challenging and emotionally draining process for all parties involved. Alongside the emotional toll, there are also numerous legal considerations to take into account, especially when it comes to the division of assets. One question that often arises during a divorce is, &ldquo;Who gets the ring?&rdquo; In this article, we will explore the legalities and emotional considerations surrounding the ownership of the wedding ring in a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="legal-considerations-for-determining-ownership-of-the-wedding-ring">Legal considerations for determining ownership of the wedding ring</h2>
<p>When it comes to determining ownership of the wedding ring in a divorce, the legal system takes a variety of factors into account. Generally, the division of assets in a divorce follows the principle of equitable distribution, which means that assets are divided fairly but not necessarily equally. However, there are some states that adhere to community property laws, where assets acquired during the marriage are typically split equally between the spouses.</p>
<p>In most cases, the wedding ring is considered separate property and is not subject to division during a divorce. This means that the person who originally received the ring, typically the spouse who was proposed to, gets to keep it. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, if the ring was a family heirloom or if it was given as a gift to both spouses, the courts may determine that it should be divided between the parties.</p>
<h2 id="pre-nuptial-agreements-and-their-impact-on-the-division-of-assets">Pre-nuptial agreements and their impact on the division of assets</h2>
<p>Pre-nuptial agreements, or prenups, are legal contracts that couples enter into before getting married. These agreements outline how assets will be divided in the event of a divorce. If a couple has a prenup that specifically addresses the ownership of the wedding ring, then the terms of the agreement will typically supersede any default laws. This means that the ring will be awarded according to what is stated in the prenup.</p>
<p>It is important to note that prenups are not always enforceable, especially if they were signed under duress or if they are considered to be unfair. Each state has its own laws regarding the validity and enforceability of prenups, so it is crucial to consult with a family law attorney to ensure that your prenup will hold up in court. In any case, having a prenup can provide clarity and peace of mind when it comes to the division of assets, including the wedding ring.</p>
<h2 id="emotional-considerations-surrounding-the-wedding-ring-in-a-divorce">Emotional considerations surrounding the wedding ring in a divorce</h2>
<p>While the legal aspects of the division of assets are important to consider, it is equally crucial to acknowledge the emotional significance of the wedding ring in a divorce. The wedding ring symbolizes the commitment and love shared between two individuals, and its sentimental value can often outweigh its monetary worth.</p>
<p>For many people, the decision of who gets to keep the wedding ring is not solely based on the legalities, but also on the personal significance and emotional attachment they have to the ring. Some individuals may choose to keep the ring as a reminder of the relationship and the memories associated with it, while others may prefer to sell or return the ring as a way to move on and start anew.</p>
<p>It is important for both parties to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings regarding the wedding ring. If there is a strong emotional attachment to the ring, it may be helpful to seek the guidance of a therapist or divorce counselor to navigate the emotional complexities involved in the division of assets.</p>
<h2 id="case-studies-and-examples-of-different-outcomes-in-divorce-settlements">Case studies and examples of different outcomes in divorce settlements</h2>
<p>To better understand the various outcomes in divorce settlements, let&rsquo;s take a look at a few case studies and examples.</p>
<p>In one case, a couple had a prenuptial agreement that clearly stated that the wedding ring would be returned to the spouse who originally received it in the event of a divorce. The court upheld the terms of the prenup, and the ring was awarded to the spouse who was proposed to.</p>
<p>In another case, a couple had no prenuptial agreement, and the wedding ring was a family heirloom that had been passed down for generations. The court decided that the ring should be returned to the spouse who had familial ties to it, as it was considered separate property.</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate the importance of having clear and enforceable agreements in place, as well as the potential influence of sentimental value and family history on the division of assets, including the wedding ring.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-negotiating-the-division-of-assets-including-the-wedding-ring">Tips for negotiating the division of assets, including the wedding ring</h2>
<p>Negotiating the division of assets, including the wedding ring, can be a delicate process. Here are some tips to help navigate this challenging aspect of divorce:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Open communication:</strong> Discuss your preferences and feelings regarding the wedding ring with your spouse. It is important to have an open and honest conversation to reach a mutually agreeable solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider sentimental value:</strong> Take into account the emotional significance of the wedding ring for both parties. If one person has a stronger attachment to the ring, it may be worth considering their desire to keep it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek professional advice:</strong> Consult with a <a href="/">family law attorney</a> who specializes in divorce to understand your legal rights and options. They can provide guidance on how to approach the division of assets, including the wedding ring, based on your specific circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explore alternatives:</strong> If neither party wants to keep the wedding ring, consider alternative options such as selling it and splitting the proceeds or donating it to a charitable organization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Remember, the goal is to find a resolution that is fair and equitable for both parties involved.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-state-laws-in-determining-the-ownership-of-the-wedding-ring">The role of state laws in determining the ownership of the wedding ring</h2>
<p>The ownership of the wedding ring in a divorce is often influenced by state laws. As mentioned earlier, some states follow the principle of equitable distribution, while others adhere to community property laws. It is important to familiarize yourself with the laws of your specific state to understand how they may impact the division of assets, including the wedding ring.</p>
<p>For example, in community property states, assets acquired during the marriage are generally considered joint property and are divided equally between the spouses. This means that the wedding ring would likely be subject to division. On the other hand, in equitable distribution states, the courts aim to divide assets fairly but not necessarily equally, which may result in different outcomes regarding the ownership of the wedding ring.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-keeping-or-selling-the-wedding-ring-in-a-divorce">Alternatives to keeping or selling the wedding ring in a divorce</h2>
<p>If neither party wants to keep or sell the wedding ring, there are alternative options to consider. One option is to repurpose the ring into a piece of jewelry that can be worn or displayed in a different form. For example, the ring could be redesigned into a pendant or a brooch. This way, the sentimental value of the ring can be preserved while giving it a new purpose.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to donate the ring to a charitable organization. By doing so, you can turn the negative emotions associated with the divorce into a positive act of giving. There are many organizations that accept jewelry donations and use the proceeds to support various causes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the choice of what to do with the wedding ring in a divorce is a personal decision. It is important to consider what will bring closure and emotional healing for both parties involved.</p>
<h2 id="seeking-legal-advice-and-guidance-during-the-divorce-process">Seeking legal advice and guidance during the divorce process</h2>
<p>Navigating the complexities of a divorce can be overwhelming, which is why it is crucial to seek legal advice and guidance. A family law attorney specializing in divorce can provide you with the necessary information and support to make informed decisions regarding the division of assets, including the wedding ring.</p>
<p>An experienced attorney will help you understand your rights, explain the applicable laws in your state, and guide you through the negotiation process. They can also assist in drafting or reviewing any legal agreements, such as prenuptial agreements, to ensure they are fair and enforceable.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-final-thoughts-on-the-division-of-assets-including-the-wedding-ring">Conclusion and final thoughts on the division of assets, including the wedding ring</h2>
<p>Divorce is a challenging and emotionally charged process, especially when it comes to the division of assets, including the wedding ring. While the legalities play a significant role in determining ownership, it is equally important to consider the emotional significance of the ring.</p>
<p>By understanding the legal considerations, exploring alternatives, and seeking professional guidance, you can navigate the division of assets in a way that is fair and equitable for both parties involved.

<h2 id="understanding-settlement-agreements-in-divorce-cases">Understanding settlement agreements in divorce cases</h2>
<p>Divorce is a challenging process that can have significant financial implications. When going through a divorce, one of the most important documents you can have is a settlement agreement. A settlement agreement is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms of the divorce, including the division of assets and liabilities. It is a crucial tool in protecting your assets and securing your financial future.</p>
<p>A settlement agreement is typically negotiated between the divorcing parties with the assistance of their attorneys. It allows the couple to reach an agreement on important issues such as property division, spousal support, child custody, and child support. By coming to a mutual understanding and documenting it in a settlement agreement, both parties can avoid the uncertainty and costs associated with a court trial.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-a-settlement-agreement-in-protecting-your-assets">The importance of a settlement agreement in protecting your assets</h2>
<p>One of the primary reasons why a settlement agreement is important in a divorce is that it helps protect your assets. Without a settlement agreement, the court will have the authority to divide your assets and liabilities based on the applicable laws in your jurisdiction. This can often lead to an outcome that may not be favorable to either party.</p>
<p>With a settlement agreement, however, you have the opportunity to negotiate and determine how your assets will be divided. This allows you to have more control over the process and ensures that your assets are protected in a way that aligns with your specific needs and priorities. By including detailed provisions in the settlement agreement, you can safeguard your financial future and ensure a fair distribution of assets.</p>
<h2 id="real-life-divorce-settlement-examples">Real-life divorce settlement examples</h2>
<p>To better understand the impact of a settlement agreement, let&rsquo;s consider a few real-life divorce settlement examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>John and Sarah have been married for 15 years and have accumulated substantial assets during their marriage, including a family home, investments, and retirement accounts. Through a settlement agreement, they were able to agree on a fair division of their assets, ensuring that both parties received an equitable share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lisa and David have two children and have decided to get a divorce. With the help of their attorneys, they were able to create a settlement agreement that addressed child custody, visitation rights, and child support. This agreement provided stability and clarity for their children, minimizing the emotional impact of the divorce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emily and Michael have a high net worth and complex financial portfolios. They were able to negotiate a settlement agreement that accounted for their specific financial circumstances, including business interests, investments, and tax considerations. This agreement allowed them to protect their assets and minimize potential tax consequences.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples highlight the importance of a settlement agreement in ensuring a fair and equitable outcome in a divorce. It allows couples to tailor the agreement to their unique circumstances and protect their assets in the best possible way.</p>
<h2 id="key-elements-to-include-in-a-settlement-agreement">Key elements to include in a settlement agreement</h2>
<p>When creating a settlement agreement, it is essential to include key elements that will protect your assets and secure your future. Here are some important provisions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/">Property division</a>: Clearly outline how your assets, including real estate, bank accounts, investments, and personal property, will be divided between the parties.</p>

<h2 id="financial-considerations-in-a-divorce-settlement">Financial considerations in a divorce settlement</h2>
<p>A divorce settlement agreement is not just about dividing assets and liabilities. It also involves important financial considerations that can impact your long-term financial well-being. Here are some financial aspects to keep in mind when negotiating a settlement agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Valuation of assets:</strong> Obtain accurate valuations of your assets, including real estate, investments, retirement accounts, and business interests. This will ensure a fair division of assets based on their current market value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Future financial needs:</strong> Consider your future financial needs, including housing, living expenses, healthcare, and retirement. Ensure that the settlement agreement adequately addresses these needs and provides for your long-term financial security.</p>

<p><strong>Tax implications:</strong> Understand the potential tax consequences of the settlement agreement. Consult with a tax professional to ensure that the agreement takes into account any tax liabilities or benefits that may arise from the division of assets or spousal support.</p>

<p>Negotiating a fair settlement agreement requires open communication, compromise, and a focus on long-term goals. Here are some tips to help you negotiate a fair agreement:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize your goals:</strong> Clearly define your goals and priorities before entering into negotiations. This will help you stay focused and make informed decisions during the negotiation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek professional advice:</strong> Consult with financial advisors, accountants, or other experts who can provide valuable insights and guidance throughout the negotiation process. Their expertise can help you assess the long-term financial implications of the settlement agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remain open-minded:</strong> Be willing to consider different options and solutions. Remember that negotiation is a give-and-take process, and compromise may be necessary to reach a fair agreement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Focus on the big picture: Keep your long-term financial well-being in mind. It is important to evaluate the settlement agreement based on how it will impact your future, rather than solely focusing on immediate gains or losses.</p>

<h2 id="enforcing-a-settlement-agreement-in-court">Enforcing a settlement agreement in court</h2>
<p>Once a settlement agreement is reached, it is essential to ensure that it is legally enforceable. If one party fails to comply with the terms of the agreement, the other party may need to seek enforcement through the court system. Here are some steps to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Consult with your attorney:</strong>   If the other party is not fulfilling their obligations under the settlement agreement, consult with your attorney. They will guide you through the enforcement process and advise you on the best course of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Document the breach:</strong> Keep detailed records of any instances where the other party fails to comply with the settlement agreement. This documentation will be crucial if you need to pursue enforcement in court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mediation or alternative dispute resolution:</strong> Consider mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods before resorting to litigation. These processes can help resolve disputes without the need for a court trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File a motion for enforcement:</strong> If all other options fail, your attorney can file a motion with the court to enforce the settlement agreement. The court will review the motion and may take action to ensure compliance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enforcing a settlement agreement can be a complex and time-consuming process. It is crucial to work closely with your attorney and follow the appropriate legal procedures to protect your rights and ensure compliance with the agreement.</p>

<p>When it comes to child support cases in San Diego, the process can be complex and emotionally taxing for both parents and children.

<h2 id="introduction-to-child-support-in-california">Introduction to Child Support in California</h2>
<p>Child support is a financial obligation that both parents must share after separation or divorce to ensure their children maintain a similar quality of life as they did prior to the dissolution of the marriage. In California, child support payments are calculated based on a specific formula, which takes into account various factors such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each parent&rsquo;s income</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount each parent contributes to raising and caring for the children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability of each parent to provide financial support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs of daycare, education, and extracurricular activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special needs of the children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child support obligations from other relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of children from the marriage or relationship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Healthcare expenses and health insurance premiums</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences between the custodial and noncustodial home that may be corrected with adequate child support payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs of travel for visitation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding these factors and how they apply to your specific situation is crucial in order to establish a fair child support arrangement for your children.</p>

<p>There are several steps involved in establishing child support in San Diego, which may include:</p>
<h3 id="filing-a-petition-for-child-support">Filing a petition for child support</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you and your former partner cannot reach an agreement on child support, you will need to file a petition with the San Diego Child Support Courthouse to request a court order for child support payments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="determining-parentage">Determining parentage</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the child is not a product of the marriage, you may also need to request a court order to establish parentage before child support can be ordered.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gathering-financial-information">Gathering financial information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both parents will need to provide complete financial disclosures, including income, expenses, assets, and debts, to help the court determine the appropriate child support amount.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="calculating-child-support">Calculating child support</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using the California child support guidelines and the financial information provided by both parents, the court will calculate the appropriate child support amount.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issuing-a-child-support-order">Issuing a child support order</h3>

</ul>
<p>Throughout this process, a family law attorney can provide guidance and support to help you navigate the complexities of the San Diego Child Support Courthouse.</p>
<h2 id="factors-that-may-influence-child-support-modifications">Factors That May Influence Child Support Modifications</h2>
<p>In some cases, a parent may request a modification of a child support order due to significant changes in circumstances. Some factors that the court may consider when evaluating a child support modification request include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A significant increase or decrease in a parent&rsquo;s income</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A significant increase or decrease in health insurance costs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in a parent&rsquo;s responsibility for caring for the child (e.g., due to a change in child custody or visitation arrangements)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other significant changes in a parent&rsquo;s financial or life circumstances</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that your child support order should be modified, consult with a family law attorney to discuss your options and the best course of action for your situation.</p>
<h2 id="collecting-overdue-child-support-payments-in-san-diego">Collecting Overdue Child Support Payments in San Diego</h2>
<p>If your former partner fails to make child support payments or consistently makes late payments, a San Diego child support attorney can help you pursue the overdue support payments. It is important to note that withholding visitation rights from the noncustodial parent in an attempt to force payment of child support is not a legal option. Instead, consult with a family law attorney to explore your options for collecting past-due child support payments.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-californias-no-fault-divorce-laws-on-child-support">The Impact of California&rsquo;s No-Fault Divorce Laws on Child Support</h2>
<p>California is a no-fault divorce state, which means that the spouse filing for divorce does not need to prove that the other spouse was at fault for the dissolution of the marriage. Instead, the couple can divorce on the basis of &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo; This also means that the fault of either parent will generally not be considered when determining child custody or child support arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="when-child-support-payments-are-required">When Child Support Payments Are Required</h2>
<p>In general, the parent who is granted primary physical custody of the children (the custodial parent) will receive child support payments from the other parent (the noncustodial parent). However, even if divorced parents share custody equally, the higher-earning parent may still be required to pay child support if there is a significant income disparity between the two parents.</p>
<p>In California, child support payments are mandatory until the child turns 18 or, if the child is unmarried and still enrolled in high school, until the child turns 19 or graduates from high school, whichever comes first.</p>
<h2 id="how-a-san-diego-child-support-attorney-can-help">How a San Diego Child Support Attorney Can Help</h2>
<p>While the state of California has guidelines in place for calculating child support payments, it is always advisable to hire an experienced family law attorney to assist you in your child support case. State child support guidelines may not always be set in stone, and with the help of a skilled attorney, you may be able to present certain extenuating circumstances to the court to ensure that you receive the maximum amount of financial support your child is entitled to.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is to secure a fair child support arrangement that allows your children to maintain a similar quality of life as before the divorce. Whether you need help drafting a child support agreement, representing you in court, or collecting overdue child support payments, a San Diego family law attorney can provide the expertise and support you need to protect your legal rights and ensure the best outcome for your children.</p>

<p>San Diego, California, is home to many families who may find themselves navigating the complex world of child custody battles. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the ins and outs of child custody in San Diego, touching on topics such as parenting plans, legal and physical custody, and how to navigate the family law system. By the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of the child custody process and how to make informed decisions for your family’s future.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-child-custody-in-san-diego">Understanding Child Custody in San Diego</h2>
<p>Child custody refers to the legal and physical care, control, and maintenance of a minor child. It is a critical aspect of family law that seeks to protect the best interests of the child involved. In San Diego, child custody cases require the creation of a parenting plan, which outlines the rights and responsibilities of each parent regarding their child&rsquo;s care, living arrangements, and time spent with each parent.</p>
<h2 id="parenting-plans">Parenting Plans</h2>
<p>A parenting plan is a crucial document in any child custody case. It outlines essential aspects of care, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How the child will be cared for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the child will live</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the child will see each parent</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Parenting plans must prioritize the best interests of the child. It is important to note that until a court order is in place, both parents have equal rights to make decisions on behalf of their child.</p>
<h2 id="legal-and-physical-custody">Legal and Physical Custody</h2>
<p><a href="/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">Child custody</a> can be divided into two categories: legal custody and physical custody.</p>
<p>Legal custody involves the right to make significant decisions for the child, including decisions related to health care, education, and welfare. Legal custody can be either joint or sole.</p>
<h2 id="joint-legal-custody">Joint legal custody</h2>
<p>Both parents share the rights and responsibilities for making important decisions about the child.</p>
<h2 id="sole-legal-custody">Sole legal custody</h2>
<p>Only one parent has the right and responsibility to make these decisions.</p>
<p>Physical custody refers to the parent with whom the child lives most of the time. Like legal custody, physical custody can be joint or sole.</p>
<h2 id="parenting-time-and-visitation">Parenting Time and Visitation</h2>
<p>Parenting time, also known as visitation, is a schedule outlining when the child will spend time with each parent. There are four main types of parenting time orders:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>With a schedule:</strong> A specific schedule that includes dates, times, holidays, and special occasions. This type of order is helpful for providing structure and consistency for the child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reasonable:</strong> A flexible, open-ended arrangement that allows parents to work out the schedule themselves. This type of order requires good communication and cooperation between parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supervised:</strong> Used in cases where the child&rsquo;s safety or well-being is a concern. Visitation with the non-custodial parent is supervised by the other parent, another adult, or a professional agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>No visitation:</strong> Implemented when any form of visitation, even supervised, would be physically or emotionally harmful to the child.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If parents cannot agree on a parenting plan, a judge will decide based on the child&rsquo;s best interests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="factors-affecting-child-custody-decisions">Factors Affecting Child Custody Decisions</h2>
<p>When determining child custody, San Diego judges consider several factors to ensure the best interests of the child. These factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The age and health of the child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emotional ties between the child and each parent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The child&rsquo;s ties to their school, home, and community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability of each parent to care for the child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any history of family violence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular and ongoing substance abuse by either parent</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigating-the-family-law-system-in-san-diego">Navigating the Family Law System in San Diego</h2>
<p>When dealing with child custody cases in San Diego, it is essential to understand the family law system and the necessary steps to take.</p>
<h2 id="filing-papers-with-the-court">Filing Papers with the Court</h2>
<p>There are various types of cases and documents you can file to request a child custody and visitation order. The type of case or papers you need to file depends on your situation, such as whether you are married or if you have already filed a family law case.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate forms for your case, you can utilize online resources, like the California Courts Self-Help Center, or consult with a legal professional.</p>
<h2 id="responding-to-court-documents">Responding to Court Documents</h2>
<p>If you receive court documents regarding child custody, it is crucial to respond in a timely manner. Your response options, required forms, and deadlines depend on the specific documents you receive. Failing to respond can result in a judge making a decision without your input.</p>
<h2 id="seeking-legal-assistance">Seeking Legal Assistance</h2>
<p>Navigating the family law system can be overwhelming, especially when dealing with the emotional turmoil of a child custody battle. Seeking legal counsel from a skilled family law attorney can help alleviate some of the stress and ensure that your rights and your child&rsquo;s best interests are protected.</p>

<p>In California, the division of property and debts during a divorce is governed by the community property law. This law can have a significant impact on divorce settlements in San Diego, often leading to complex and contentious situations. Understanding the intricacies of California&rsquo;s property law is essential for anyone going through a divorce in the state. This article will provide a comprehensive overview of the community property law, its impact on divorce settlements, and the role of family law professionals like 619 Divorce in assisting individuals navigating this complex area.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-californias-community-property-law">Understanding California&rsquo;s Community Property Law</h2>
<p>California is one of the few states in the United States that follows the community property law. This law dictates how property and debts acquired during a marriage are divided upon divorce. Under this law, assets and debts accumulated during the marriage are considered community property, meaning they belong to both spouses equally.</p>
<h3 id="community-property">Community Property</h3>
<p>Community property includes all income earned and assets acquired during the marriage, as well as debts incurred. Common examples of community property include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wages and salary earned by either spouse during the marriage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homes, cars, and other tangible assets purchased during the marriage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank accounts, retirement plans, and investment accounts held jointly or in the name of either spouse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debts incurred during the marriage, such as mortgages, car loans, and credit cards</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="separate-property">Separate Property</h2>
<p>Separate property, on the other hand, refers to assets and debts that belong to an individual spouse. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assets and debts acquired before the marriage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property acquired during the marriage through inheritance or gift</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property acquired after the date of separation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that separate property can become commingled with community property if not maintained separately. For example, if a spouse uses separate property funds to contribute to the mortgage of a jointly-owned home, the separate property may become partially community property.</p>
<h2 id="impact-of-community-property-law-on-divorce-settlements">Impact of Community Property Law on Divorce Settlements</h2>
<p>The community property law significantly impacts how assets and debts are divided during a divorce in San Diego. Below are some key ways this law affects divorce settlements.</p>
<h2 id="equal-division-of-community-property">Equal Division of Community Property</h2>
<p>Under the community property law, spouses are entitled to an equal share of all community property and debts. This means that all assets and debts accumulated during the marriage must be divided equally between the spouses, regardless of their individual contributions or needs. This can lead to disputes, especially in cases where one spouse believes they contributed more to the acquisition of assets or the other spouse was responsible for most of the debt.</p>
<h2 id="determining-community-and-separate-property">Determining Community and Separate Property</h2>
<p>Identifying which assets and debts are community property and which are separate property can be a complex process. This requires a thorough examination of each spouse&rsquo;s financial history, including the source of funds used to acquire assets and the nature of debts incurred. Disagreements over the classification of assets and debts can lead to prolonged legal disputes.</p>
<h2 id="commingling-of-property">Commingling of Property</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, separate property can become commingled with community property if not kept separate during the marriage. This can lead to disputes over the ownership of assets and the division of property. In cases where property is part community and part separate, a detailed analysis is required to determine the proportionate interests of each spouse.</p>
<h2 id="valuation-of-assets-and-debts">Valuation of Assets and Debts</h2>
<p>Another challenge in dividing property under the community property law is determining the value of assets and debts. This includes assessing the current market value of real estate, the value of investment accounts, and the present value of retirement plans and pensions. Accurate valuation is essential to ensure a fair division of property and may require the assistance of experts such as appraisers and financial advisors.</p>
<h2 id="role-of-family-law-professionals-in-property-division">Role of Family Law Professionals in Property Division</h2>
<p>Given the complexities of California&rsquo;s property law and its impact on divorce settlements, it is crucial to seek the assistance of a knowledgeable family law professional. 619 Divorce, a leading family law firm in San Diego, offers a risk-free consultation to help clients navigate the challenges of property division during a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="legal-representation">Legal Representation</h2>
<p>A skilled family law attorney can provide invaluable advice and representation during the property division process. They can help determine the classification of assets and debts, negotiate an equitable division of property, and advocate for their client&rsquo;s interests in court if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="mediation-and-collaborative-divorce">Mediation and Collaborative Divorce</h2>
<p>In cases where spouses can cooperate, alternative dispute resolution methods such as <a href="/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">mediation and collaborative divorce</a> can be used to resolve property division issues. Family law professionals like mediators and collaborative divorce attorneys can facilitate negotiations and help spouses reach an agreement that is fair and in compliance with the community property law.</p>
<h2 id="financial-experts">Financial Experts</h2>
<p>Family law professionals can also recommend financial experts such as appraisers, accountants, and investment advisors who can assist in the valuation of assets and debts. These experts can provide objective assessments of the value of property, ensuring that the division of assets and debts is based on accurate information.</p>
<h2 id="619-divorce-offers-a-risk-free-consultation">619 Divorce Offers a Risk Free Consultation</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;Real Housewives of Orange County&rdquo; (RHOC) is no stranger to drama, but the recent events surrounding cast member Shannon Beador and her ex-husband, David, have taken things to a new level. The two were spotted together despite their tumultuous history, sparking rumors and concerns among fans. This news comes as David has filed for divorce from his new wife, Lesley. In this article, we will delve into the details of the Beador family&rsquo;s legal matters, the impact on their children, and the role that family law plays in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="the-beador-family-a-history-of-conflict">The Beador Family: A History of Conflict</h2>
<p>Shannon Beador joined the cast of RHOC in 2014, and her marriage to David quickly became a central storyline. The couple had been married for 17 years and had three children together. However, their relationship was fraught with tension and infidelity, eventually leading to their separation in 2017 and subsequent divorce in 2019.</p>
<h2 id="davids-new-marriage-and-recent-divorce-filing">David&rsquo;s New Marriage and Recent Divorce Filing</h2>
<p>Following his divorce from Shannon, David married Lesley in 2020. The couple has a 2-year-old daughter named Anna Love. However, their marriage has been far from smooth sailing, with David filing for divorce in September 2021, only to request a dismissal a month later.</p>
<p>In May 2022, David filed for divorce once again, citing irreconcilable differences and listing their date of separation as May 23rd. This filing is similar to the previous one, as David has requested the termination of the court&rsquo;s ability to award spousal support to Lesley, citing the existence of a prenuptial agreement.</p>
<h2 id="the-unexpected-reunion-shannon-and-davids-recent-encounter">The Unexpected Reunion: Shannon and David&rsquo;s Recent Encounter</h2>
<p>In the midst of David&rsquo;s ongoing divorce proceedings, Shannon posted a photo of the two of them together on social media. While some fans were happy to see them remaining friendly, others expressed shock and concern, given the couple&rsquo;s tumultuous history.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-on-their-children">The Impact on Their Children</h2>
<p>Shannon and David&rsquo;s three children, Sophie, Adeline, and Stella, have been caught in the crossfire of their parents&rsquo; conflicts.

<h2 id="custody-battles-and-visitation-rights">Custody Battles and Visitation Rights</h2>
<p>In his recent divorce filing, David has requested legal and <a href="/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">physical custody</a> of Anna Love, with visitation rights granted to Lesley. This is a change from his previous filing, where he sought joint custody.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-court-in-custody-decisions">The Role of the Court in Custody Decisions</h2>
<p>When determining custody arrangements, the court&rsquo;s primary concern is the best interests of the child. Factors considered may include the child&rsquo;s age, the parents&rsquo; ability to provide care and support, and the child&rsquo;s relationship with each parent.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-a-parenting-plan">The Importance of a Parenting Plan</h2>

<h2 id="prenuptial-agreements-and-spousal-support">Prenuptial Agreements and Spousal Support</h2>
<p>David&rsquo;s recent divorce filing highlights the role of <a href="/san-diego-prenuptial-agreement-lawyer/">prenuptial agreements</a> in family law. A prenup is a legally binding document that outlines the couple&rsquo;s financial expectations and arrangements in the event of a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-a-prenuptial-agreement">The Purpose of a Prenuptial Agreement</h2>

<p>Shannon&rsquo;s recent social media post featuring her and David has raised questions about the potential impact of such content on divorce proceedings and family law matters.</p>
<h3 id="social-media-evidence-in-court">Social Media Evidence in Court</h3>
<p>In some cases, social media content can be used as evidence in court, particularly if it documents behavior or communications relevant to the case. However, the admissibility of such evidence may depend on factors such as privacy settings and the authenticity of the content.</p>
<h2 id="the-potential-consequences-of-sharing-personal-information-online">The Potential Consequences of Sharing Personal Information Online</h2>
<p>Sharing personal information online, especially during a divorce or custody dispute, can have unintended consequences. It may provoke negative reactions from friends, family, or the public, and potentially impact the outcome of legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Former Jackass star Bam Margera has recently made headlines by requesting the dismissal of his divorce from estranged wife Nikki Boyd. This article will delve into the details surrounding this development, examining the reasons for Margera&rsquo;s request, as well as the implications for both parties involved. By analyzing various reference articles on the topic, this article aims to provide a thorough examination of this ongoing legal battle.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-situation">Overview of the Situation</h2>
<p>Bam Margera, a 43-year-old former Jackass star, is currently in the midst of a divorce from his estranged wife Nikki Boyd. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Margera filed to have the divorce dismissed while simultaneously attempting to move up the next hearing. The reality star claims that his ex is not allowing him to see their young son Phoenix, although she countered in her own filing that his lack of visits is due to his poor behavior. The next scheduled hearing in his divorce case is set for July 11.</p>
<h2 id="margeras-rationale-for-dismissal-request">Margera&rsquo;s Rationale for Dismissal Request</h2>
<p>Margera&rsquo;s primary reason for requesting the dismissal of his divorce is that he claims to have never been legally married to Boyd. He stated in documents obtained by People that Boyd had never taken or used his legal name and that they had &ldquo;never been married, legally or otherwise.&rdquo; The couple had a wedding ceremony in 2013 in Reykjavik, Iceland, with Margera subsequently posting a video of the nuptials to YouTube. However, it is unclear if the couple had legal documentation of the union from Iceland or if they ever obtained a wedding license in the US.</p>
<h2 id="boyds-response-to-margeras-claims">Boyd&rsquo;s Response to Margera&rsquo;s Claims</h2>
<p>Boyd&rsquo;s attorney informed Page Six that she had been under the assumption that they had been legally married for years following the ceremony in Iceland. Her lawyer, David Glass, explained that Boyd was told the wedding would occur in Iceland and that everything was taken care of. The couple then returned to the US and lived as a married couple for years, with Boyd believing Margera had handled all necessary paperwork.</p>
<h2 id="the-concept-of-putative-spouses">The Concept of Putative Spouses</h2>
<p>In the event that Margera and Boyd were not legally married, they might still be considered &ldquo;putative spouses&rdquo; under California law. This term refers to a technically invalid union in which the parties believed themselves to be married and entered into the arrangement in good faith. This classification could have implications on the legal proceedings surrounding their divorce.</p>
<h2 id="boyds-conditions-for-visitation">Boyd&rsquo;s Conditions for Visitation</h2>
<p>In response to Margera&rsquo;s filing, Boyd claimed that he can still visit their son Phoenix, provided he is in California at the time and sober. This appears to be a thinly veiled shot at Margera, who has spent time out of state and on the East Coast in recent months, which would seemingly make visitation impossible under the current rules. Boyd&rsquo;s attorney told TMZ, &ldquo;Mr. Margera continues to claim to be the &lsquo;injured&rsquo; party because he isn&rsquo;t seeing Phoenix &ndash; even though he placed himself 3000 miles away after exposing the child to abuse and drug/alcohol abuse.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="margeras-struggles-with-substance-abuse">Margera&rsquo;s Struggles with Substance Abuse</h2>
<p>Although Margera claimed in late April that he was done drinking alcohol, his brother has accused him of having a methamphetamine habit. Jess Margera stated in a tweet that Bam is &ldquo;unrecognizable&rdquo; since his meth habit and that he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;know what [Bam is] capable of.&rdquo; This revelation adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing divorce proceedings and the issue of visitation with their young son.</p>
<h2 id="margeras-legal-troubles">Margera&rsquo;s Legal Troubles</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, Bam Margera turned himself in after criminal charges were filed against him. He is accused of assaulting his brother and making terroristic threats to other family members. The skater was released on $50,000 bail after entering a not guilty plea. These legal issues may further impact the outcome of the divorce case and <a href="/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">visitation rights</a> with his son.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-divorce-on-margeras-career">The Impact of Divorce on Margera&rsquo;s Career</h2>
<p>Margera&rsquo;s ongoing divorce and legal troubles have undoubtedly had an impact on his career in the entertainment industry. With a reputation built on his antics as a member of Jackass, these recent developments may tarnish his image and make it challenging for him to find work in the future. This could have financial implications for both Margera and his estranged wife, particularly if spousal support or child support payments are required.</p>
<h2 id="the-divorce-process-in-san-diego-california">The Divorce Process in San Diego, California</h2>
<p>The divorce process in San Diego, California, where Margera and Boyd&rsquo;s case is being heard, typically involves several steps. These include filing a petition for dissolution of marriage, serving the petition and any required accompanying documents, and waiting for the response from the other party. The process can be lengthy and complex, particularly when children or significant assets are involved. Margera&rsquo;s request to have the divorce dismissed adds another layer of complexity to an already convoluted process.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-custody-and-visitation-rights">Implications for Custody and Visitation Rights</h2>
<p>If the divorce is dismissed, the implications for custody and visitation rights for Margera and Boyd could be significant. With allegations of substance abuse and criminal behavior leveled against Margera, it is possible that the court may not grant him the same level of access to his son as he might have under different circumstances. The outcome of this case remains to be seen, but it is clear that the situation is highly contentious and far from resolved.</p>

<p>The ongoing divorce case between Bam Margera and Nikki Boyd is a multifaceted and complex situation, with numerous factors at play. From Margera&rsquo;s request to dismiss the divorce due to the alleged lack of a legal marriage, to Boyd&rsquo;s insistence on visitation conditions and accusations of substance abuse, the case has captured significant attention. As the case unfolds in San Diego, California, the ultimate outcome remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: this tumultuous situation will likely have a lasting impact on both Margera and Boyd&rsquo;s lives, as well as the life of their young son, Phoenix.</p>

<p>Domestic violence is a term used to describe any pattern of behavior that one partner uses to gain or maintain power and control over another partner in an intimate relationship. Domestic violence can take many forms, including physical, emotional, psychological, economic, and sexual abuse. It is a pervasive and serious problem that affects millions of people worldwide. In this article, I will explore the definition, types, causes, and statistics of domestic violence, as well as the impact on victims, hidden scars, coping mechanisms, treatment, prevention, and the importance of domestic violence awareness.</p>
<h2 id="definition-of-domestic-violence">Definition of Domestic Violence</h2>
<p>Domestic violence is a form of abuse that occurs within an intimate relationship. It involves the use of physical, sexual, emotional, psychological, or economic abuse to gain or maintain power and control over a partner. Domestic violence can happen to anyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. It can take many forms, including hitting, punching, kicking, slapping, choking, pushing, or using weapons. It can also include threats, intimidation, isolation, humiliation, stalking, or controlling access to money, resources, or transportation.</p>
<p>Domestic violence is a serious crime that can have long-lasting effects on the victim, their family, and the community. It can lead to physical injuries, mental health problems, substance abuse, homelessness, poverty, and even death. Domestic violence is not a private matter that should be kept secret or ignored. It is a public health issue that requires a coordinated community response to prevent and respond to effectively.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-domestic-violence">Types of Domestic Violence</h2>
<p>Domestic violence can take many forms, including physical, sexual, emotional, psychological, and economic abuse. Physical abuse involves any form of physical harm, such as hitting, pushing, choking, or using weapons. Sexual abuse involves any unwanted sexual contact, such as rape, sexual assault, or forcing sex. Emotional abuse involves any behavior that undermines a person&rsquo;s self-esteem or sense of worth, such as name-calling, belittling, or humiliating. Psychological abuse involves any behavior that threatens, intimidates, or controls a person, such as gaslighting, isolation, or stalking. Economic abuse involves any behavior that limits a person&rsquo;s access to financial resources or forces them to depend on their partner, such as controlling finances, stealing money, or preventing them from working.</p>
<p>Each form of domestic violence can have a profound impact on the victim&rsquo;s physical, emotional, and mental well-being. The effects can be immediate or long-lasting, depending on the severity and duration of the abuse. Domestic violence can also affect children who witness the abuse, leading to a cycle of violence that can continue for generations.</p>
<h2 id="causes-of-domestic-violence">Causes of Domestic Violence</h2>
<p>Domestic violence is a complex issue that has no single cause. It is often the result of multiple factors, including individual, cultural, and societal factors. Some individual factors that may contribute to domestic violence include low self-esteem, poor impulse control, substance abuse, and mental health problems. Cultural factors that may contribute to domestic violence include gender roles, social norms, and attitudes toward violence. Societal factors that may contribute to domestic violence include poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to resources.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that domestic violence is never caused by the victim&rsquo;s behavior. It is always the responsibility of the abuser to stop the abuse and seek help to change their behavior. Additionally, it is important to recognize that domestic violence is not limited to any particular group of people. It can happen to anyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status.</p>
<h2 id="domestic-violence-statistics">Domestic Violence Statistics</h2>
<p>Domestic violence is a pervasive problem that affects millions of people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, one in three women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives. In the United States, one in four women and one in nine men have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Additionally, domestic violence is a leading cause of injury and death for women worldwide.</p>
<p>These statistics highlight the urgency and importance of addressing domestic violence as a public health issue. Domestic violence is not just a private matter between two individuals. It is a societal problem that requires a coordinated response to prevention, intervention, and support for victims and survivors.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-domestic-violence-on-victims">The Impact of Domestic Violence on Victims</h2>
<p>Domestic violence can have a profound impact on the victim&rsquo;s physical, emotional, and mental well-being. The effects can be immediate or long-lasting, depending on the severity and duration of the abuse. Physical effects of domestic violence can include bruises, broken bones, and other injuries. Long-term physical effects can include chronic pain, disability, and even death.</p>
<p>Emotional and mental effects of domestic violence can include anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal thoughts. Victims of domestic violence may also experience feelings of shame, guilt, and low self-esteem. They may become isolated from friends and family, lose their sense of identity, and struggle to trust others.</p>
<h2 id="hidden-scars-of-domestic-violence">Hidden Scars of Domestic Violence</h2>
<p>The impact of domestic violence on victims is not limited to physical and emotional effects. There are also hidden scars that can affect a person&rsquo;s sense of self and their ability to form healthy relationships. Some of these hidden scars include:</p>
<p><strong>Loss of trust:</strong> Victims of domestic violence may struggle to trust others, even those who are close to them. They may fear that others will hurt them or betray their trust.</p>
<p><strong>Shame and guilt:</strong> Victims of domestic violence may feel ashamed of what has happened to them and guilty for not being able to prevent it. They may blame themselves for the abuse and feel like they deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>Fear and anxiety:</strong> Victims of domestic violence may experience ongoing fear and anxiety, even after the abuse has ended. They may be afraid of their abuser or fear that the abuse will happen again.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty forming healthy relationships:</strong> Victims of domestic violence may struggle to form healthy relationships with others. They may have difficulty trusting others or setting boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Negative self-image:</strong> Victims of domestic violence may have a negative self-image and struggle with low self-esteem. They may feel like they are not worthy of love or respect.</p>
<h2 id="coping-mechanisms-and-treatment-for-domestic-violence-survivors">Coping Mechanisms and Treatment for Domestic Violence Survivors</h2>
<p>Survivors of domestic violence may use a variety of coping mechanisms to deal with the impact of the abuse. Some coping mechanisms may be healthy, while others may be harmful. Healthy coping mechanisms may include seeking support from friends and family, participating in therapy or support groups, practicing self-care, and setting boundaries. Harmful coping mechanisms may include substance abuse, self-harm, or risky behaviors.</p>
<p>Treatment for survivors of domestic violence may include a combination of therapy, medication, and support groups. Therapy can help survivors process their trauma, learn healthy coping mechanisms, and build resilience. Medication may be used to treat symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD. Support groups can provide a safe and supportive environment for survivors to connect with others who have experienced similar trauma.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that healing from domestic violence is a journey, and there is no single &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to heal. Each survivor&rsquo;s journey is unique, and it is important to respect their individual needs and preferences.</p>
<h2 id="domestic-violence-prevention">Domestic Violence Prevention</h2>
<p>Preventing domestic violence requires a coordinated community response that addresses the root causes of violence, promotes healthy relationships, and provides support for victims and survivors. Some strategies for preventing domestic violence include:</p>
<p><strong>Education and awareness:</strong> Education and awareness campaigns can help increase understanding of domestic violence, break down stereotypes and myths, and promote healthy relationships.</p>
<p>*<strong>Early intervention:</strong> Early intervention programs can help identify and address domestic violence before it escalates. This may include screening programs, counseling, or legal interventions.</p>
<p>Policies and laws: Policies and laws can help create a culture of safety and accountability. This may include laws that protect victims of domestic violence, provide resources for survivors, and hold abusers accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>Support for victims and survivors: Support for victims and survivors can help them heal and rebuild their lives. This may include counseling, housing, financial assistance, and legal support.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-domestic-violence-awareness">The Importance of Domestic Violence Awareness</h2>
<p>Raising awareness about domestic violence is critical for preventing and responding to the problem. Awareness campaigns can help increase understanding of the issue, break down stereotypes and myths, and promote healthy relationships. They can also help survivors feel less isolated and more supported.</p>
<p>It is important for everyone to recognize the signs of domestic violence and know how to respond if they suspect someone is being abused. This may include listening without judgment, providing resources and support, and helping the person develop a safety plan.</p>

<h3 id="child-support">Child Support</h3>
<p>Child support is another important consideration in a divorce. Both parents are responsible for contributing to the financial well-being of their children. The amount of child support required will depend on factors such as the income of each parent, the number of children involved, and the custody arrangement.</p>

<p>Her relationship with her husband had already been strained prior to her mother-in-law&rsquo;s death. She knew they were headed to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, but neither one of them had formally said the words. But after his mother&rsquo;s death, after being consumed with grief, it was just too much to pretend that her husband could make her happy anymore. Anymore&hellip; At one point, when they first met, they were happy. The perfect picture of happiness, in fact. They had met through a mutual friend. He had been corralled into going to a trivia night at a local bar by a friend. The same friend had talked <em>him</em> into going that night too. When their eyes met for the first time, it was love. Instant love. The kind of love that only happens in movies. It had smacked both of them right in the face. They immediately set a dinner date. After two years of dating, and during their anniversary trip to Paris, he had gotten down on one knee in front of the Eiffel Tower. It really was perfect.  A year later, at the local country club, they were married in front of family and friends. Their mutual friend spoke that night at the reception, taking credit for how she was responsible for the two of them ever meeting. Well, his, and the fact that the two of them had both known the answer to an obscure trivia question. Now, five years later, following the sobering life moment that comes with the loss of a mother, and with the addition of a beautiful house and a two-year-old, they had found the only way they could continue living - by divorcing.</p>
<h3 id="something-had-changed">Something Had Changed</h3>
<p>Something had changed between them. Maybe it was the long hours she spent working as a successful realtor. Or maybe the fact that despite the fact that he was home all day with their son, he still couldn&rsquo;t manage to get the dishes put away or the clothes clean. &ldquo;What does he do all day?&rdquo; she wondered. Sure, she knew their son could be rambunctious. He <em>was</em> two! But seriously, couldn&rsquo;t her husband find some way of getting things done? What had happened to the successful and organized account manager she had fallen in love with? He knew she was not without his faults. Sure, she had had that flirtation with a co-worker a year ago. But nothing had happened. He knew she could catch the eye of any man she wanted. In fact, she had sold a few homes using his flirting techniques. But she had never actually gone through with anything. Their financial situation was fine. They were just growing apart. And then his mother died. He was swallowed up by grief. Work seemed pointless. Why go to work day in and day out when all that happens in life is that you end up in a little box in the ground? Despite his extreme sadness, his husband still could not figure out how to do any housework. He was starting to resent him. A deep, dark resentment. The kind that&rsquo;s been building up for years, ready to explode during any little argument. The well had been poisoned a while ago, maybe always, she thought. Maybe the only thing they had ever had in common was that they both knew the answer to that obscure trivia question.</p>
<h3 id="a-question-of-divorce">A Question of Divorce</h3>
<p>How would she divorce him though? He hadn&rsquo;t worked in years. If he couldn&rsquo;t even figure out how to do the laundry how was he supposed to know how to take care of himself, or file papers for that matter. He knew she would need to support him with <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">alimony payments</a>. And what about their son. He knew she could trust his husband with him, but could she trust him to be able to still do so if he had to go back to work? What would they do for the holidays? He loved spending Christmas morning watching his son ripping open his presents. What if this year she didn&rsquo;t get to have that morning? Would his and his husband be able to pull it together enough to raise this child together? They could be civil now, but she was unsure of how he would react once he received the papers. He decided to meet with a divorce attorney. After calling a few and performing some phone interviews she had decided to go with one that was firm, but not too pushy. He didn&rsquo;t want his husband to feel attacked. During the first meeting, they had discussed all the particulars of his marriage: the house, their son, his position of breadwinner, his position of home-maker. His mother had left his a small, but substantial amount of money. , a process that has been known to help decrease litigation costs. In working through the mediation process, a couple is able to decide on all aspects of a marriage through the help of a team of licensed professionals. Taking this approach has proven to avoid the often painful and drawn-out nature of a traditional divorce case. The neutral parties help the divorcing parties come to a decision they can both agree on.</p>
<h3 id="a-year-later-following-the-divorce">A Year Later Following the Divorce</h3>
<p>A year later, following an emotional mediation process, the two were divorced. They had worked out a co-parenting schedule that suited them both. It had been a transition for all of them. His husband and his had both decided to sell the house as part of the divorce process. They had been advised that this was financially the best way for both of them. His apartment was only about 10 minutes away from hiss and very close to where their house was, so their son was able to stay at the same school and keep his same friends. They wanted to keep some sense of normalcy for him. That was important to both of them. He spent one week with his husband, and one week with his. Of course, if for whatever reason he wanted to visit another parent he could, regardless of whose week it was. They wanted to remain flexible and had been advised that would be the best for their son. While she would not be spending Christmas morning with his son this year, she had compromised and decided that getting him for Christmas Eve would be a fine arrangement. Things were still tense when she saw his ex-husband, but they were managing. Every day it got a little easier. Some days were really hard. During those days she tried to surround herself with or keep herself busy. She had recently gotten into running and it helped to ease his mind. While the divorce wasn&rsquo;t easy, she was happy she could finally move forward with his new life.</p>

<p>Just like marriage, <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> has a long history. While divorce was not at all common around the time people began to get married, that doesn&rsquo;t mean thise weren&rsquo;t people wishing for the end of their marriages. Hise we walk through the history of marriage and how divorce came into &ldquo;legal&rdquo; being.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-divorce">The History of Divorce</h2>
<p>Within the English legal tradition family law was governed by the officially sanctioned church. Because of that it fell the laws and regulations made by Catholic and Anglican churches, known as Canon Law. As a result of the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 all English church authority was removed and marriage became purely a contract between two people. The U.S. First Amendment&rsquo;s Establishment Clause prevented religious authority from becoming secular law.</p>
<h2 id="common-law-marriage">Common Law Marriage</h2>
<p>In the past, children that were from a marriage that was not officially sanctioned were not allowed to inhisit their parents&rsquo; property. As a result of this legality, England created the common law marriage. Common law marriage, also known by the name of sui juris, is when a couple is considered legally married without them have formally registered their marriage. Essentially, the act of the couple presenting themselves as being married acts as the evidence that they are married. The following states allow common law marriage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>District of Columbia</li>
<li>Georgia (if created before 1/1/97)</li>
<li>Idaho (if created before 1/1/96)</li>
<li>Iowa</li>
<li>Kansas</li>
<li>Montana</li>
<li>New Hampshire (for inhisitance purposes only)</li>
<li>Ohio (if created before 10/10/91)</li>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>Pennsylvania (if created before 1/1/05)</li>
<li>Rhode Island</li>
<li>South Carolina</li>
<li>Texas</li>
<li>Utah</li>
</ul>
<p>Thise is no common law divorce which can often lead to problems regarding child custody, financial standing, etc&hellip; when a common law couple seeks to end their marriage. Annulment, separation, or divorce cannot happen unless thise is a lawful marriage or legally recognized civil union.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>  An annulment dissolves a marriage just as a divorce does. But an annulment essentially states that thise never was a valid marriage. Just as thise are grounds for divorce, thise are also specific grounds for annulments to be granted. Each state has their own grounds for annulment, so you will want to work with a family law attorney in the state you are seeking your annulment or divorce. The following are typical statutory grounds for granting an annulment:</p>
<ul>
<li>fraud</li>
<li>duress or force</li>
<li>bigamy</li>
<li>underage during the time of the marriage</li>
<li>intoxication</li>
<li>mental incapacity</li>
<li>insanity</li>
<li>impotence</li>
<li>concealed divorce</li>
<li>too close a kinship (consanguinity)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, thise are procedures that must be followed if you are seeking an annulment. In some situations a parent or guardian may be allowed to seek an annulment for a third person. Each state has different residency requirements. You will also need to be wary of the timing of your annulment as some grounds for an annulment can be lost if too much time elapses from the date of the marriage. Children born during the course of the marriage are typically treated like children in a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation is a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a separation while still remaining legally married. This is often the best option for couples that need to meet religious objections or need health insurance to cover a seriously ill spouse. A court is able to award &ldquo;separate maintenance&rdquo; as part of a legal separation. This is the equivalent of alimony and child support. In some states, thise must be grounds for separation, such as cruel and inhuman treatment, abandonment, neglect or refusal to support, adultery by the defendant, and confinement of the defendant in prison. Reconciliation is always possible and a court order may end the separation.</p>
<h2 id="grounds-for-divorce">Grounds for Divorce</h2>
<p>, and any remaining waiting period before the divorce is final. In California this waiting time is 6 months and a day. That is how long it takes for your legal status to be changed from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to &ldquo;single.&rdquo; In a no-fault state, neithis party is &ldquo;blamed&rdquo; for the end of the marriage, and typically couples choose &ldquo;irreconcilable differences,&rdquo; meaning that they are unable to make the marriage work, and will never be able to make the marriage work.  All states have some form of no-fault divorce, using words such as &ldquo;incompatibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;insupportability,&rdquo; or &ldquo;irreconcilable differences as reasons. Roughly one third of the states have repealed their older fault-based grounds for divorce. Several states also allow marrying couples to create a &ldquo;Covenant Marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="what-is-covenant-marriage">What is Covenant Marriage?</h3>
<p>Covenant marriages require the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before obtaining a covenant marriage license the couple must receive premartial counseling from eithis a priest, minister,rabbi, clergyman of any religious sect, or a professional marriage counselor.</li>
<li>The couple must legally agree to seek marital counseling if problems develop during the marriage.</li>
<li>The couple can only seek a divorce or legal separation for limited reasons, such as: adultery, the committing a felony with a sentence of imprisonment at hard labor or death, abandonment, physical or sexual abuse, habitual intemperance (for example,alcohol or drug abuse), cruel treatment, or severe ill treatment by the othis spouse. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Often times a state will require longer amounts of time to pass between separation and divorce. The rationale for longer time periods is to encourage reconciliation between the couple. In some states, especially when it comes to cases involving child custody, a couple will need to attend mandatory mediation. The <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">mediation</a> process is confidential, can be less adversarial, and is often less expensive than standard courtroom proceedings. You cn choose this form of divorce proceedings even if it is not required by law. <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">Collaborative divorce</a> is also a possibility for parties to obtain a dissolution of marriage.</p>
<h2 id="mediation-and-collaborative-law">Mediation and Collaborative Law</h2>
<p>Mediation and collaborative law are often effective choices for couples that are able to negotiate on the aspects of their marriage, including child custody and visitation, alimony, and division of marital property. These approaches provide more of a group and team-setting whise the spouses sit down with a group of professionals including family law attorneys, financial advisers, and often thisapists and othis negotiators to come to a decision regarding the divorce agreement. These approaches can often be less litigious and yield a better outcome that satisfies both spouses&rsquo; needs. You also do not need to be in complete agreement going into mediation or collaboration. Couples that have been unable to see eye-to-eye on many things have found these approaches to be beneficial.</p>

<p>Learning to co-parent is hard and co-parenting is never a one-size fits all arrangement and Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are proving that. The couple divorced last year and since divorcing have not followed a &ldquo;consistent or formal&rdquo; co-parenting schedule or custody arrangement for their 5-year-old daughter Everly. Tatum, however, has hopes that having an official custody arrangement will help the five-year-old &ldquo;thrive even more.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="channing-tatum-and-jenna-dewan-learn-to-co-parent">Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Learn to Co-Parent</h2>
<p>Channing Tatum and Jenna announced they were splitting up last year via this statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now.&rdquo; At the time of the announcement, they both committed to creating a solid co-parenting relationship for their daughter. And while committed, it has not been a consistent one. Tatum hopes to find some consistency, as was revealed in recent court documents. He is looking to have a custody and co-parenting arrangement that is &ldquo;equal, mutual and self-executing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tatum also requested custody of Everly on Mondays and Tuesdays, while Jenna will be responsible for her care on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The parents will alternate visitation on the weekends and &ldquo;equally divide and alternate&rdquo; custody during the holidays.</p>
<p>The only holiday that the parents will try to spend together is Halloween, as they did in 2018. According to the documents, they &ldquo;shall try to work together to try to spend Halloween together, trick or treating with Everly from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the fact that they have yet to find a consistent routine, Channing says, &ldquo;Since our separation and on the occasions that we have been together, Everly appears very happy and comfortable when she is with [Jenna] and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He adds, &ldquo;In my opinion and experience, Everly has appeared to adjust to our separation and living in two homes exceptionally well.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements-and-holidays">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements and Holidays</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays and every event that happens during the holidays. This means creating a holiday season schedule. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. There are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-co-parent-relationship">Create a Co-Parent Relationship</h3>
<p>Creating a relationship with your co-parent can be difficult. You may decide working with a mediator is the best option to making an agreement. Once you establish ground rules for yourself and how to maintain the relationship, over time it becomes easier. Creating a flexible schedule may help get to these &ldquo;easier&rdquo; moments. Even though these may be easier moments, there will be times when things feel impossible. Finding balance with your co-parent may help you both become better people and better parents to your children. By being cooperative with your co-parent, you establish a pattern of life for your children which can carry into the future. The number one priority you and your co-parent need to do is to make sure you put the best interests of your child first.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hie are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side while scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>

<p>The official California Courts website advises that grandparents should consider <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">mediation</a> before they pursue going to court for those grandparent visitation rights. “There are a number of problems with pursuing a grandparent visitation claim in family court,” said Gerald Maggio, a divorce mediator located in Orange County. “To start, the courts have huge backlogs. And once a case does get to the front of the line, the family is often ordered to see a mediator anyway.”</p>
<h3 id="how-mediation-can-help-with-grandparent-visitation-rights">How Mediation Can Help with Grandparent Visitation Rights</h3>
<p>The California Courts website suggests that the best way to reach an agreement regarding grandparent visitation rights is through mediation. This is due to the fact that it better serves the child as well as the family through reducing conflicts, time, and money spent on court proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="no-clear-procedure-for-getting-grandparent-visitation-rights">No Clear Procedure for Getting Grandparent Visitation Rights</h3>
<p>Additionally, there really is no clear-cut procedure for grandparents to file an official claim. The claim might need to either be filed under an already existing case or filed as an entirely new case. In fact, there is no official form to file for grandparent visitation rights. “Some grandparents think that they have to file an official claim because their child’s ex-spouse is too unreasonable for mediation,” said Maggio. “But those are often the families that can benefit the most from mediation. Litigation just exacerbates conflict and bad feelings while costing everyone a lot of money.” Grandparent visitation rights are often covered by the parenting plan that is put together during the divorce mediation process. But if the family has decided to go through court, rather than through mediation, often do not include grandparent visitation rights in their co-parenting plan. For families that have pursued court procedures, Maggio noted that these families might want to turn to a divorce or child custody mediator in order to create a specific agreement that includes the grandparent-child relationship.

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the process of getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, looking for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">spousal support</a>, or anticipate paying spousal support, you need to understand some important things. While a family law attorney can provide you with specifics about your situation, here are a few general things to know, including tax laws, awarding of spousal support, and what would happen if spousal support payments are not made.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-spousal-support">What is Spousal Support?</h2>
<p>Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intended to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to another.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many other factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In other words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal support payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must prove your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whether you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however, this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determining spousal support, the court usually requires the highest earner, whether they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-financial-situation-changes-affect-spousal-support">How do Financial Situation Changes Affect Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The length of spousal support payments could also depend on whether the spouse who is getting the support has any changes in their financial situation, such as starting a new job or getting a raise. The purpose of spousal support is to make sure the spouse receiving it has financial safeguards. If the spouse receiving support doesn&rsquo;t need it anymore in order to maintain their financial stability, the court may decide that they no longer need the spousal support they are receiving.</p>
<h3 id="spousal-support-and-divorce-decision-tax-strategy">Spousal Support and Divorce Decision Tax Strategy</h3>
<p>There are certain basic tax laws you have to keep in mind during and after your divorce if you&rsquo;re going to be paying or receiving spousal support. The bottom line if receiving spousal support is that you have to declare it as income on your taxes. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re paying it, you get to deduct it on your taxes. Spousal support is different from child support since child support is neither declared nor deducted on your taxes.</p>
<h3 id="taxes-and-divorce-ruling">Taxes and Divorce Ruling</h3>
<p>When calculating spousal support (i.e., alimony) agreements, you have to remember this rule since it impacts the bottom line of your finances. The decision and ruling reflect your intentions when it&rsquo;s time to do your taxes. For example, you may decide that the spouse who is paying the spousal support should agree to pay the tax liability of the spouse who is receiving the spousal support. You should discuss this with your family law attorney during the hearing for your spousal support determination. If you&rsquo;re still on good terms with your spouse, it would be helpful to discuss and decide on the best tax deal that would work for you both. If you&rsquo;re not on good times, this might be difficult to come to a mutual tax deal decision, but if you can manage come to a mutual agreement it will save both of you lots of time and headaches when it&rsquo;s tax season. If you get spousal support you should prepare for a potential impact when tax time comes. Your ex isn&rsquo;t able to withhold income taxes from your support checks, which means you have to account for the taxes when you file your tax return. Because of this, you may want to consider paying taxes on a quarterly basis, which will save you from being hit with a big tax liability when April 15th comes around. If you&rsquo;re paying spousal support remember you can deduct the payments on your income taxes. However, you can&rsquo;t deduct child support or any property distribution. The IRS frequently scrutinizes spousal support payments for the first three years you make the payments. This is to make sure that you&rsquo;re not disguising the spousal support payments as property distribution or something else related to your divorce. A divorce attorney understands all the ins and outs of tax issues relating to divorce and can help you understand the issues during the spousal support hearings and afterward after you begin to make the payments.</p>
<h3 id="not-keeping-up-with-spousal-support-payments">Not Keeping Up with Spousal Support Payments</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual to fall behind when it comes to spousal support payments. This can be caused by various reasons including, job loss, being unable to get a job, or just negligence. If you&rsquo;re receiving the payments, your whole life can be put in disarray and have a damaging effect on it. Here are some suggestions if your ex-spouse falls behind on spousal support payments or fails to make them.</p>
<h3 id="not-receiving-court-ordered-alimony-payments">Not Receiving Court-Ordered Alimony Payments?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re court-ordered alimony payments aren&rsquo;t being received, attempt to discover the reason. See if your ex lost their job recently. Perhaps they were injured and unable to work. If these are the reasons, try to see if the two of you can work out a plan that will make up the lost payments as well as future payments. An attorney can provide an unbiased opinion when it comes to situations like this, and will also provide any legal proof in case you need to take your unpaying ex to court.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-avoid-not-receiving-alimony-payments">How to Avoid Not Receiving Alimony Payments</h3>
<p>If your ex can make spousal payments, has a job, has no injuries, and just doesn&rsquo;t want to pay the court-ordered alimony payments, then you need the legal help of a divorce attorney. A motion will have to be filed in court requesting that a judge order your spouse to pay the past-due alimony payments. The motion also includes the agreement requiring them to keep current on future alimony payments. You should work with a family law attorney experienced in these matters who can draft a legal motion regarding this. The attorney will also be able to serve in court as your representative.</p>
<h3 id="consequences-of-alimony-non-payment">Consequences of Alimony Non-Payment</h3>
<p>There are a number of punishments and fines the court can order for delinquent spouses. The laws governing deliquent spousal payments include various consequences that are different from one state to anothis, but they generally include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contempt charges for the spouse, including fines and jail time.</li>
<li>Withholding the spouse&rsquo;s income. This requires the deliquent spouse’s employer to withhold the spousal support payment amount their paycheck. Then the money is then sent directly to the spouse who is supposed to receive it.</li>
<li>Writ of Execution, which is when the judge gives a portion of the bank accounts or othis assets of the delinquent spouse to the spouse who is supposed to be receiving alimony.</li>
<li>If the amount of delinquent alimony is substantial, you may be able to request that the court issue a money judgment against the spouse for the whole amount owed, including interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contacting a family law attorney will help you to file legal actions to enforce the payment of alimony and to make sure you receive the spousal support owed to you. Thise are various things to be taken into consideration during divorce and spousal support decision. A skilled and qualified family law attorney can assist you to make sure you receive a fair case.

<p>As we announced at the end of last year, tax changes are coming to divorce in 2019. Are you prepared for them? If not, you might want to start getting somethings together because this year&rsquo;s tax season might be just a little more harrowing than last years.</p>
<h2 id="get-ready-for-tax-season">Get Ready for Tax Season</h2>
<p>Tax determinations are a crucial aspect of property division in a divorce. A number of tax law changes were implemented at the end of 2017 and affected 2018 taxes, but one of the biggest changes to tax law won&rsquo;t happen until Jan. 1, 2019. As of Jan. 1, 2019, alimony will no longer be a tax deduction for the person paying it, and it will no longer have to be claimed as income by the person receiving it. You’ll want to work with a family law attorney that understands this change. When it comes to tax penalties relating to asset distribution, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure you don&rsquo;t get hit as a result of this tax law change.</p>
<h2 id="finances-after-divorce">Finances After Divorce</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve decided to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">end your marriage</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of your emotional life, and that definitely doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of your financial freedom. There is nothing easy about ending a marriage. You&rsquo;re going to feel out of place for a while. Everything is new. Chances are you&rsquo;ve had to rearrange your schedule to now pick up the kids from their dad&rsquo;s house every other weekend. It might mean you&rsquo;re not spending Christmas with your parents so that the children can spend Hanukkah with their mom&rsquo;s family. You might need to set up an automatic child support and spousal support payment to your ex-husband for every third week of the month. Or maybe you need to call your now ex-wife to make sure that she drops off the soccer cleats at the school that your son left at his house over the weekend. Regardless of what the situation is, things have changed. And that means your financial situation has. But just because everything is different, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should steer your course for financial ruin. Yes, losing a second income is hard. It can be especially hard if you were living off of one income and now have to go back to the land of the full-time worker. These are some tips and tricks that can help ensure that your divorce doesn&rsquo;t translate to financial ruin.</p>
<h2 id="tips-from-the-experts">Tips From the Experts</h2>
<p>Here are some tips from some financial experts; certified divorce financial analyst Eva Sachs, Emily McBurney, an attorney and qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO) expert, and certified divorce financial analyst Donna Cheswick.</p>
<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<p>Sachs says the first step toward financial independence is balancing your income with your expenses. This can be hard to do if you&rsquo;ve never had to in the past. He advises you sit down and look at how much money is coming in from various avenues like work, alimony and/or child support payments, and then assess how much of that is going toward living expenses. &ldquo;Think of it as a spending plan rather than a budget,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Knowing where your money goes is key, especially after divorce. These will be many new expenses you might not have thought about prior to your divorce; this is a critical time to refrain from spending money you don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; <strong>Who Are Your Benefactors?</strong> Most likely your spouse was your main benefactor before your divorce. So one of the first things you need to do, according to McBurney is update the beneficiary on your life insurance and retirement accounts. &ldquo;Review all of your accounts and insurance policies and change the beneficiaries. A divorce does <em>not</em> automatically terminate your former spouse’s rights to be the beneficiary on your retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies –- even though your divorce decree might say that your former spouse has waived all rights to the benefits,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You will need to formally submit a change of beneficiary form to each financial institution. Otherwise, the benefit will be paid to whoever is listed on their forms at the time of your death &ndash; regardless of your divorce.&rdquo; Take this opportunity to reflect on the people in your life that are around to support you and encourage you. This can be a hard step, changing your beneficiary, because you&rsquo;ve never imagined having to remove your spouse. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want to revise your will, says Cheswick. &ldquo;Meet with an estate planning attorney to discuss your state’s laws regarding possible updates to your will, power of attorney and advanced directives,&rdquo; she suggests. &ldquo;You want to be sure that your former spouse is no longer entitled to any distribution in the event of your death. And if your settlement agreement requires one party to maintain life insurance on the other, then there needs to be a method in place to be sure this is actually occurring. Just because the former spouse says they will do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are following through.&rdquo; <strong>Emergency Funds</strong> When you and your spouse were married, you knew you could rely on each other if one of you lost your job, had a medical emergency, or if something in the house needed immediate repair. But now if anything unexpected pops up, you&rsquo;re going to alone. This can be scary. But if you&rsquo;re smart about it, and plan for it, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Sachs recommends, to help protect yourself, create an emergency fund that you continue adding to whenever you have the chance. &ldquo;An emergency fund should equal three to six months of your living expenses,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If you can swing it, I recommend six months because you&rsquo;re now single and need an even bigger cushion if you are not able to work or an emergency occurs.&rdquo; <strong>Really Finalize</strong> Even though the divorce papers are signed an finalized, according to Cheswick, your work isn&rsquo;t really complete until you&rsquo;ve ensured the assets awarded in the settlement have been distributed. This means doing your due diligence and following up with your spouse and all the shared accounts that you used to have. If the information and assets have not been transferred to you, you will need to ensure that they are. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of people who will contact me months (and unfortunately even years) after their divorce is finalized and there are still outstanding items which have not been resolved,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Remember that the agreement is a legally binding contract that you both signed and agreed to uphold. If one party is failing to comply with the terms of the contract then the other party has every right to take steps to ensure their compliance including going back to court to have the agreement enforced.&rdquo; .&quot; <strong>You Still Need to Plan for Retirement</strong> As the divorce gets closer to being finalized, Sachs advises looking to ways of maximizing your retirement savings. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let divorce stop you from planning for your future,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Investing in your 401K plan will allow you to save for retirement. You can begin by saving a small amount each week and then let it build slowly or make payroll contributions that match your employer contributions. Don&rsquo;t stop thinking of the future!&rdquo; Just because you are no longer going to be sharing your golden years with your ex-spouse, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have the time of your life. Getting your financial situation under control is the first step to taking back your life and claiming your bright future.</p>
<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
<p>After your divorce is finalized you&rsquo;ll be able to reclaim your life and do things you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. Follow whatever it is that your heart desires. By doing so you are offering yourself to the world and finding your own unique way that makes you feel alive. You can choose to stay shut in by the pain of loss and old wounds, but remember that the world will continue to turn. Don&rsquo;t you want to be a part of it?</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>We all know divorce is a common occurrence in Hollywood. We see it in the tabloids whenever we&rsquo;re in line at local grocery stores or othis places with magazine stands. These tabloids routinely announce the latest divorces and how much the divorcing celebrity spouses will receive as part of the <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="(619) DIVORCE - 619 Divorce">divorce</a> settlement. A few years ago we thought it was common knowledge that in America one in every two marriages end in divorce. A rate of 50%. But it may not be accurate that America is in the midst of a divorce crisis. Instead of a divorce crisis, it might actually be a marriage crises, as in a crisis about getting married to begin with. Tons of people, young and old, have been questioning whethis &ldquo;wedded bliss&rdquo; is really blissful.</p>
<h2 id="some-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-to-think-about">Some Marriage and Divorce Statistics to Think About</h2>
<p>Over time thise appears to have been in shift in our thoughts about marriage and divorce. We may not even have been aware of this shift. But think about the following statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the latest statistics from the U.S. Census, while the overall divorce rate has been slightly dropping nationwide, it&rsquo;s rising among 25-29-year olds.</li>
<li>One in 10 first-time marriages fail in the first five years.</li>
<li>According to the analysis of Pew Research Center, 51% of today&rsquo;s adults are married compared to 72% in 1960. This means between 2009 and 2010, new marriages fell by 5%.</li>
<li>Government data indicates that over half of births to women under 30 occur out of wedlock. &ldquo;This is quite amazing,&rdquo; biological anthropologist Helen Fishis, Ph.D., of Rutgers University says. &ldquo;A hundred years ago, if you had a child out of marriage, you&rsquo;d be a social disgrace. Today women feel comfortable enough economically and culturally to bring up a child without a recognized commitment from a man.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions-about-marriage-and-divorce-problems">Conclusions About Marriage and Divorce Problems</h3>
<p>Based on this compelling data, instead of a divorce problem, we may be having a marriage problem. It might make sense to say that marriage is becoming a failing trend that we could refer to as something some people &ldquo;used to do&rdquo;!</p>
<h3 id="a-survey---is-marriage-a-thing-of-the-past">A Survey - Is Marriage a Thing of the Past?</h3>
<p>Glamour magazine did a recent survey of over 2100 woman and 1000 men between 18 and 40 about how they felt about marriage today in America. Did they think it could become a part of history. According to their answers, this is still a debatable question.</p>
<h3 id="marriage-maybe-not-someday">Marriage? Maybe Not Someday!</h3>
<p>Out of the people asked, 92% said they still want to get married. Someday! Most people still dream of that big, white, wedding day! Women are more skeptical of marriage. Approximately 51% of surveyed women under 30 felt the institution of marriage has become outdated. &ldquo;This is really a breathtaking statistic,&rdquo; Marriage Confidential author Pamela Haag, Ph.D., said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d asked this 60 years ago, a lot of women would have been too busy making dinner for their husband or running after their children to even take the survey, and they couldn&rsquo;t afford to not be married. Today thise are so many othis options. Marriage might still be the preferred dream. But it&rsquo;s not the exclusive dream.&rdquo; Many women feel the same way. According to 26-year old Washington, D.C., resident Melody Wilson, &ldquo;At some point I would like to be able to say &lsquo;my husband&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;my boyfriend.&rsquo;&rdquo; He and his boyfriend have been togethis for four years. &ldquo;But if I never got married, I wouldn&rsquo;t feel shunned or inept at relationships, which I might have if I lived decades ago.&rdquo; Reno, NV, resident Vanessa Vancour, 27, explains this idea furthis, &ldquo;Having a ring and legal documentation does not guarantee commitment, devotion, or happiness. Weddings can be beautiful, but beyond the pretty dress and a few legal rights, I don&rsquo;t see the point.&rdquo; These two women obviously don&rsquo;t speak for all, especially since 49% surveyed still consider marriage to still be a timeless institution. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the ultimate sign of commitment,&rdquo; 22-year old Nashville resident Megan Brames says. &ldquo;I want to know my partner is serious about spending his life with me.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="mens-thoughts-about-marriage">Men&rsquo;s Thoughts About Marriage</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising to learn that men tend to be more traditional than women. Of the men surveyed, 55% don&rsquo;t intend on giving up when it comes to saying &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; According to Fishis, &ldquo;Despite the myth that men are less committed, they are predisposed to desire marriage.&rdquo; Apparently this may have something to do with evolution, as she explains, &ldquo;He wants to keep the mothis of his children around to ensure his DNA lives on.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="why-marriage-is-losing-faith">Why Marriage is Losing Faith!</h3>
<p>So why are young women seeminly losing faith in marriage? Could all those Hollywood tabloid stories be the reason? Apparently it&rsquo;s definitely a factor. According to the survey, 44% of women say all that Hollywood drama fuels the divorce rate. Furthis research might explain furthis. A controversial 2010 study by Harvard University, University of California San Diego, and Brown University, made the suggestion that divorce was catching. For example, if your friends ends his marriage, your risk of getting a divorce increases by 14%. If it&rsquo;s a sibling that decides &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; the risk of your following suit increases to 22%. In this digital and TMZ-obsessed world, viewing stars as &ldquo;Just Like Us&rdquo; affects our view of marriage as well as divorce. &ldquo;I think of Heidi Klum as a friend,&rdquo; says 25-year old Orlando, FL, resident Ashley Spencer. &ldquo;I follow his on Twitter and love all his projects. I really thought she and Seal were going to go the distance. So when I heard she was getting a divorce, it was like hearing an actual friend was ending his marriage.&rdquo; Caitlin Brody, a 25-year old from New York City took the breakup of Klum-Seal really hard. &ldquo;They seemed in love beyond belief. He freakin&rsquo; had an igloo made for the proposal! It can be hard to believe in happily ever after if even supermodels and award-winning musicians can&rsquo;t make it.&rdquo; In othis words, if celebrities can&rsquo;t make it work in their dream-world bubble, how can the rest of us? Is this really realistic?</p>
<h3 id="are-celebrity-couples-like-us-or-not">Are Celebrity Couples Like Us, or Not?</h3>
<p>While we all have challenges, celebrity couples have additional, unique challenges the average person doesn&rsquo;t. These include long days, months, and sometimes years on location with their sexy co-stars, and being bombarded with droves of fans who are love-struck trying to get close to them 24-hours every day. Los Angeles resident Laura Jansen, 24, sums it this way, &ldquo;I am just not on the same planet as Demi and Ashton.&rdquo; In spite of this, the survey indicates that women tended to be affected more when couples they know personally break up. The survey indicates 63% of these women get upset when their friend or somebody they know gets divorced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s depressing,&rdquo; Wilson says. &ldquo;And sometimes I find myself hoping it doesn&rsquo;t happen to me.&rdquo; According to Haag, that feeling &ldquo;gets at the ripple effect of anxiety and fear that one divorce can have among friends. While divorce might not be, strictly speaking, a viral phenomenon, I&rsquo;ve seen how catalyzing one breakup can be within a small community.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="how-celebrity-divorces-might-help">How Celebrity Divorces Might Help</h3>
<p>Celebrity divorces may actually be helpful though. Many times divorce, whethis it&rsquo;s you, your parents, or you or your family&rsquo;s friends, is kept hush-hush because nobody is supposed to talk about it. New York University sociology professor and the author of &ldquo;Going Solo&rdquo; says, &ldquo;While it can be difficult to speak our mind when someone close to us divorces, riffing on Heidi and Seal helps us to process it. We&rsquo;re interested in celebrities&rsquo; revolving-door marriages because so many of us have experienced the same thing among our circle.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="the-upside-in-views-of-marriage">The Upside In Views of Marriage</h3>
<p>Anothis upside to this view of marriage is the pressure that&rsquo;s taken off women when it comes to getting married. The survey revealed that approximately 33% of women would feel fine checking the &ldquo;single&rdquo; box for the rest of their life. And 59% felt divorce was healthy, especially if the couple fell out of love with each othis. Klinenberg says, &ldquo;Thirty years ago people in a bad marriage felt they had to justify getting divorced—to themselves and to their friends and family. Today they have to justify staying togethis. Very few think that if they get divorced, their life will be over. The country is full of single people living big lives.&rdquo;  503-3050</p>

Learn more about 10 risk factors of divorce.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Are you at risk for divorce?  According to relationship experts, there are divorce “risk factors.” Read on to read what the top 10 are.</p>
<h2 id="10-risk-factors-for-divorce">10 Risk Factors for Divorce</h2>
<p>Like risk factors for heart disease or liver cancer, the traits and habits listed below don&rsquo;t <em>cause</em> divorce. They simply raise a couple’s odds of divorce. <strong>Your Parents are Divorced.</strong> &ldquo;A lot of the scientific evidence to date has suggested that seeing your parents go through a divorce contributes to your own propensity to experience divorce yourself,” author Jessica Salvatore, PhD, assistant professor of psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University, told <em>Health</em> in an interview. <strong>You Have Different Alcohol Habits.</strong> A 2014 University of Buffalo study found that among couples in which one person was a heavy drinker and the other was not, 45 to 55% divorced before reaching their 10th anniversary. <strong>You Were Married Young</strong> <strong>You&rsquo;re Attractive.</strong> Authors of a paper published in the journal <em>Personal Relationships</em> found physical attractiveness was linked to a higher likelihood of getting divorced. <strong>You Had an Expensive Wedding.</strong> During a 2015 study done by Emory University, it was found that women whose weddings totaled more than $20,000 were 3.5 times more likely to divorce than women whose weddings cost between $5,000 and $10,000. Men and women who ended up spending less than $1,000 on their nuptials, were the least likely to divorce. <strong>You Got Pregnant Quickly After Getting Married</strong>.  Data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), found that women (in a first marriage) who waited to have a baby at least eight months after their wedding day were more likely to make it to their 15th anniversary than women who had a baby before the big day or within the first seven months.</p>
<p><strong>You Had a Daughter First.</strong>  A 2014 study published in the journal Demography suggests marriages that are already headed for divorce might actually produce baby girls because of a concept called &ldquo;the female survival advantage&rdquo;. “Girls may well be surviving stressful pregnancies that boys can’t survive,” said study co-author Amar Hamoudi. “Thus girls are more likely than boys to be born into marriages that were already strained.”</p>
<p><strong>You Didn&rsquo;t Finish College.</strong>  A 2012 National Health Statistics report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed women and men who completed college had a 78% and 65% chance, respectively, of their marriages lasting at least a decade. Among women and men with a high school diploma, just 41% and 47% had a chance of the same marriage duration. Women and men with some college education, but not a bachelor’s degree, had a 49% and 54% of a marriage lasting two decades.</p>
<p><strong>You Were Raised without a Religion.</strong>  According to data from a 2012 National Health Statistics study, Protestant women had a 50% chance of their marriage lasting a decade. Catholic women had a 53% chance of their marriage lasting a decade. Women raised in “other religions” had a 65% chance of staying married that long. Women who were not raised with a religion had only a 43% chance.</p>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve Already Been Divorced.</strong> According to CDC data, about 35% of first marriages end within 10 years, while about 40% of second marriages end within that period.</p>
<h2 id="divorcehttps619divorcecomsan-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer-san-diego-collaborative-law--divorce-mediation-lawyer"><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">Divorce</a></h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce. In fact, there are various forms of divorce available (of course, you will need to ensure your state laws regarding these types of divorce), including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce.  <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involved a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations, and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce. Regardless of if you want a divorce, want a legal separation, need an annulment, or decide to cancel a divorce like the Dempsey&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s always advised that you work with a divorce attorney.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>It&rsquo;s understandable - the last thing you want to talk about during your engagement is divorce. But for some - if not most or all - the best thing you can do for your marriage is sign a prenuptial agreement. You&rsquo;ll wish you had signed a prenup if your &ldquo;I&rsquo; do&rsquo;s&rdquo; become &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t anymore&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="how-a-prenup-will-save-your-divorce">How a Prenup Will Save Your Divorce</h2>
<p>A prenuptial agreement should be a consideration for any couple, but they can be an especially important consideration for the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>older couples (because they typically have acquired assets);</li>
<li>those who come into a marriage with assets;</li>
<li>people who have children from prior relationships;</li>
<li>people who expect future significant income, such as high-net-worth individuals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High Net-Worth Divorce</strong>High Net-Worth Divorce is a unique divorce scenario that involves parties who, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission are situations <em>“in which a natural person who has individual net worth, or joint worth with the person’s spouse, that exceeds $1 million dollars at the time of purchase, excluding the value of the primary residence of such person; or a natural person with an income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year.”</em>  Such a financial situation carries with it specific differences that require the skill of an experienced high net-worth divorce lawyer. With the expertise of a reputable high net-worth attorney, you can greater protect your assets and finances from the costly divorce process. <strong>Small Percentage of the Population</strong> , 619 Divorce will provide you with the excellent legal counsel you require for maximizing your success in the courtroom.</p>
<h2 id="prenuptial-agreements-for-everyone">Prenuptial Agreements for Everyone</h2>
<p>But prenups aren&rsquo;t just for the super-rich. As Joslin Davis, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, explains, creating a prenuptial agreement — or for unmarried couples, a cohabitation agreement — can make sense for many people. &ldquo;It requires people to think ahead,&rdquo; she said. Young couples can also benefit from the creation of a prenuptial agreement because it provides them a chance to plan out issues like paying off one partner&rsquo;s student-loan debt, or compensation for leaving the workforce to care for their future children.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-mistakes-in-a-prenuptial-agreement">Avoid Mistakes in a Prenuptial Agreement</h3>
<p>If there are mistakes in a prenup it can be declared invalid, which can cause much greater headaches should your marriage turn to divorce. Some common mistakes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same Legal Representation – Both spouses need separate attorneys to ensure each understands the prenuptial agreement independently of the other. This ensures the signing of the final prenuptial agreement is voluntary, without one spouse feeling as if they are being pressured into signing it.</li>
<li>Signed Under Duress – If one party feels pressured into signing the prenuptial agreement, or if they were influenced by drugs or alcohol affecting their mental capacity, it can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Signed Too Soon Before the Wedding - Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to sign the prenuptial agreement. If the couple divorces soon after the wedding, an argument that one party was coerced into signing can be argued. The prenuptial agreement should be signed one to three months before the wedding to give the spouse sufficient time to think about and consider what they are signing.</li>
<li>No Full Disclosure – Make sure the prenuptial agreement discloses all assets and debts.</li>
<li>Child Support Provisions – Do not include child custody or support. If the couple divorces and children are involved, the court will rule in whatever is the best interests of the child and not what was in the prenuptial agreement. If child custody and support are included the whole prenuptial agreement can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Biased - If the prenuptial agreement seems biased towards one spouse party, it can be decided it&rsquo;s unenforceable or “unconscionable.”</li>
<li>Unenforceable Provisions – If a prenup has unusual provisions, such as who does the dishes or takes out the garbage, they can be deemed unenforceable, which will weaken it.</li>
<li>Oral Agreement – A prenuptial agreement should be in written and multiple copies made. Each spouse and spouse&rsquo;s attorney should have a copy of the prenuptial agreement.</li>
<li>Ambiguous Writing – If anything is unclear, or there is ambiguous wording, the prenuptial agreement can be challenged in court.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marital-property-division">Marital Property Division</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to do everything you can to protect yourself financially. Doing so means completely understanding <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhabited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the higher wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. You&rsquo;ll want to work with a divorce attorney in the state in which you are divorcing so they can help advise you on your state&rsquo;s specific laws regarding property division.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s January! Which means, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> month!</p>
<h1 id="its-divorce-month">It&rsquo;s Divorce Month!</h1>
<p>January has often been called &ldquo;Divorce Month&rdquo; by relationship experts and family law attorneys for years. Why? Because of the increase in divorces that are often seen as the year changes. &ldquo;January is divorce month, because psychologically people want to start the new year with new beginnings,&rdquo; explains Jacqueline Newman, an attorney at a New York-based law firm that handles divorce cases. As Newman explains, &ldquo;Couples tolerate the holidays, because nobody really wants to tuck a divorce summons in someone&rsquo;s stocking. I find that in January, my office has a lot of initial consultations with new clients who want to better understand what their lives would look like if they were to divorce.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-divorce">The History of Divorce</h2>
<p>Within the English legal tradition, family law was governed by the officially sanctioned church. Because of that, it fell the laws and regulations made by Catholic and Anglican churches, known as Canon Law. As a result of the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 all English church authority was removed and marriage became purely a contract between two people. The U.S. First Amendment&rsquo;s Establishment Clause prevented religious authority from becoming secular law.</p>
<h2 id="common-law-marriage">Common Law Marriage</h2>
<p>In the past, children that were from a marriage that was not officially sanctioned were not allowed to inherit their parents&rsquo; property. As a result of this legality, England created the common law marriage. Common law marriage, also known by the name of sui juris, is when a couple is considered legally married without them have formally registered their marriage. Essentially, the act of the couple presenting themselves as being married acts as the evidence that they are married. The following states allow common law marriage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>District of Columbia</li>
<li>Georgia (if created before 1/1/97)</li>
<li>Idaho (if created before 1/1/96)</li>
<li>Iowa</li>
<li>Kansas</li>
<li>Montana</li>
<li>New Hampshire (for inheritance purposes only)</li>
<li>Ohio (if created before 10/10/91)</li>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>Pennsylvania (if created before 1/1/05)</li>
<li>Rhode Island</li>
<li>South Carolina</li>
<li>Texas</li>
<li>Utah</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no common law divorce which can often lead to problems regarding child custody, financial standing, etc&hellip; when a common law couple seeks to end their marriage. Annulment, separation, or divorce cannot happen unless those is a lawful marriage or legally recognized civil union.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>An annulment dissolves a marriage just as a divorce does. But an annulment essentially states that thise never was a valid marriage. Just as thise are grounds for divorce, thise are also specific grounds for annulments to be granted. Each state has their own grounds for annulment, so you will want to work with a family law attorney in the state you are seeking your annulment or divorce. The following are typical statutory grounds for granting an annulment:</p>
<ul>
<li>fraud</li>
<li>duress or force</li>
<li>bigamy</li>
<li>underage during the time of the marriage</li>
<li>intoxication</li>
<li>mental incapacity</li>
<li>insanity</li>
<li>impotence</li>
<li>concealed divorce</li>
<li>too close a kinship (consanguinity)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, thise are procedures that must be followed if you are seeking an annulment. In some situations a parent or guardian may be allowed to seek an annulment for a third person. Each state has different residency requirements. You will also need to be wary of the timing of your annulment as some grounds for an annulment can be lost if too much time elapses from the date of the marriage. Children born during the course of the marriage are typically treated like children in a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation is a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a separation while still remaining legally married. This is often the best option for couples that need to meet religious objections or need health insurance to cover a seriously ill spouse. A court is able to award &ldquo;separate maintenance&rdquo; as part of a legal separation. This is the equivalent of alimony and child support. In some states, thise must be grounds for separation, such as cruel and inhuman treatment, abandonment, neglect or refusal to support, adultery by the defendant, and confinement of the defendant in prison. Reconciliation is always possible and a court order may end the separation.</p>
<h2 id="grounds-for-divorce">Grounds for Divorce</h2>
<p>, and any remaining waiting period before the divorce is final. In California this waiting time is 6 months and a day. That is how long it takes for your legal status to be changed from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to &ldquo;single.&rdquo; In a no-fault state, neithis party is &ldquo;blamed&rdquo; for the end of the marriage, and typically couples choose &ldquo;irreconcilable differences,&rdquo; meaning that they are unable to make the marriage work, and will never be able to make the marriage work.  All states have some form of no-fault divorce, using words such as &ldquo;incompatibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;insupportability,&rdquo; or &ldquo;irreconcilable differences as reasons. Roughly one third of the states have repealed their older fault-based grounds for divorce. Several states also allow marrying couples to create a &ldquo;Covenant Marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="what-is-covenant-marriage">What is Covenant Marriage?</h3>
<p>Covenant marriages require the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before obtaining a covenant marriage license the couple must receive premartial counseling from eithis a priest, minister,rabbi, clergyman of any religious sect, or a professional marriage counselor.</li>
<li>The couple must legally agree to seek marital counseling if problems develop during the marriage.</li>
<li>The couple can only seek a divorce or legal separation for limited reasons, such as: adultery, the committing a felony with a sentence of imprisonment at hard labor or death, abandonment, physical or sexual abuse, habitual intemperance (for example,alcohol or drug abuse), cruel treatment, or severe ill treatment by the othis spouse. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Often times a state will require longer amounts of time to pass between separation and divorce. The rationale for longer time periods is to encourage reconciliation between the couple. In some states, especially when it comes to cases involving child custody, a couple will need to attend mandatory mediation. The <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">mediation</a> process is confidential, can be less adversarial, and is often less expensive than standard courtroom proceedings. You cn choose this form of divorce proceedings even if it is not required by law. <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">Collaborative divorce</a> is also a possibility for parties to obtain a dissolution of marriage.</p>
<h2 id="mediation-and-collaborative-law">Mediation and Collaborative Law</h2>
<p>Mediation and collaborative law are often effective choices for couples that are able to negotiate on the aspects of their marriage, including child custody and visitation, alimony, and division of marital property. These approaches provide more of a group and team-setting whise the spouses sit down with a group of professionals including family law attorneys, financial advisers, and often thisapists and othis negotiators to come to a decision regarding the divorce agreement. These approaches can often be less litigious and yield a better outcome that satisfies both spouses&rsquo; needs. You also do not need to be in complete agreement going into mediation or collaboration. Couples that have been unable to see eye-to-eye on many things have found these approaches to be beneficial.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>

<p>One of the hardest times to &ldquo;be a co-parent&rdquo; is on Christmas. Regardless of how you break up the day - either morning and night or Christmas Eve/ Christmas Day, you&rsquo;re always going to feel like you&rsquo;re missing out on at least one part of the holiday. The best way to deal with this is to make arrangements ahead of time. Making decisions the day-of will just make the situation harder.</p>
<h2 id="christmas-co-parenting">Christmas Co-Parenting</h2>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements-and-holidays">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements and Holidays</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays and every event that happens during the holidays. This means creating a holiday season schedule. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. There are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-co-parent-relationship">Create a Co-Parent Relationship</h3>
<p>Creating a relationship with your co-parent can be difficult. You may decide working with a mediator is the best option to making an agreement. Once you establish ground rules for yourself and how to maintain the relationship, over time it becomes easier. Creating a flexible schedule may help get to these &ldquo;easier&rdquo; moments. Even though these may be easier moments, there will be times when things feel impossible. Finding balance with your co-parent may help you both become better people and better parents to your children. By being cooperative with your co-parent, you establish a pattern of life for your children which can carry into the future. The number one priority you and your co-parent need to do is to make sure you put the best interests of your child first.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hie are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side while scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-grandparent-visitation-considerations">What About Grandparent Visitation Considerations?</h2>
<p>.</p>
<h3 id="mediation-before-court">Mediation Before Court</h3>
<p>The official California Courts website advises that grandparents should consider <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">mediation</a> before they pursue going to court for those grandparent visitation rights. “There are a number of problems with pursuing a grandparent visitation claim in family court,” said Gerald Maggio, a divorce mediator located in Orange County. “To start, the courts have huge backlogs. And once a case does get to the front of the line, the family is often ordered to see a mediator anyway.”</p>
<h3 id="how-mediation-can-help-with-grandparent-visitation-rights">How Mediation Can Help with Grandparent Visitation Rights</h3>
<p>The California Courts website suggests that the best way to reach an agreement regarding grandparent visitation rights is through mediation. This is due to the fact that it better serves the child as well as the family through reducing conflicts, time, and money spent on court proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="no-clear-procedure-for-getting-grandparent-visitation-rights">No Clear Procedure for Getting Grandparent Visitation Rights</h3>
<p>Additionally, there really is no clear-cut procedure for grandparents to file an official claim. The claim might need to either be filed under an already existing case or filed as an entirely new case. In fact, there is no official form to file for grandparent visitation rights. “Some grandparents think that they have to file an official claim because their child’s ex-spouse is too unreasonable for mediation,” said Maggio. “But those are often the families that can benefit the most from mediation. Litigation just exacerbates conflict and bad feelings while costing everyone a lot of money.” Grandparent visitation rights are often covered by the parenting plan that is put together during the divorce mediation process. But if the family has decided to go through court, rather than through mediation, often do not include grandparent visitation rights in their co-parenting plan. For families that have pursued court procedures, Maggio noted that these families might want to turn to a divorce or child custody mediator in order to create a specific agreement that includes the grandparent-child relationship.

<p>Tax changes are coming to divorce in 2019. Are you prepared for them?</p>
<h2 id="tax-changes-coming-to-divorce-in-2019">Tax Changes Coming to Divorce in 2019</h2>
<p>Tax determinations are a crucial aspect of property division in a divorce. A number of tax law changes were implemented at the end of 2017 and affected 2018 taxes, but one of the biggest changes to tax law won&rsquo;t happen until Jan. 1, 2019. As of Jan. 1, 2019, alimony will no longer be a tax deduction for the person paying it, and it will no longer have to be claimed as income by the person receiving it. You’ll want to work with a family law attorney that understands this change. When it comes to tax penalties relating to asset distribution, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure you don&rsquo;t get hit as a result of this tax law change.</p>
<h2 id="finances-after-divorce">Finances After Divorce</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve decided to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">end your marriage</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of your emotional life, and that definitely doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of your financial freedom. There is nothing easy about ending a marriage. You&rsquo;re going to feel out of place for a while. Everything is new. Chances are you&rsquo;ve had to rearrange your schedule to now pick up the kids from their dad&rsquo;s house every other weekend. It might mean you&rsquo;re not spending Christmas with your parents so that the children can spend Hanukkah with their mom&rsquo;s family. You might need to set up an automatic child support and spousal support payment to your ex-husband for every third week of the month. Or maybe you need to call your now ex-wife to make sure that she drops off the soccer cleats at the school that your son left at his house over the weekend. Regardless of what the situation is, things have changed. And that means your financial situation has. But just because everything is different, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should steer your course for financial ruin. Yes, losing a second income is hard. It can be especially hard if you were living off of one income and now have to go back to the land of the full-time worker. These are some tips and tricks that can help ensure that your divorce doesn&rsquo;t translate to financial ruin.</p>
<h2 id="tips-from-the-experts">Tips From the Experts</h2>
<p>Here are some tips from some financial experts; certified divorce financial analyst Eva Sachs, Emily McBurney, an attorney and qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO) expert, and certified divorce financial analyst Donna Cheswick.</p>
<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<p>Sachs says the first step toward financial independence is balancing your income with your expenses. This can be hard to do if you&rsquo;ve never had to in the past. He advises you sit down and look at how much money is coming in from various avenues like work, alimony and/or child support payments, and then assess how much of that is going toward living expenses. &ldquo;Think of it as a spending plan rather than a budget,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Knowing where your money goes is key, especially after divorce. These will be many new expenses you might not have thought about prior to your divorce; this is a critical time to refrain from spending money you don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; <strong>Who Are Your Benefactors?</strong> Most likely your spouse was your main benefactor before your divorce. So one of the first things you need to do, according to McBurney is update the beneficiary on your life insurance and retirement accounts. &ldquo;Review all of your accounts and insurance policies and change the beneficiaries. A divorce does <em>not</em> automatically terminate your former spouse’s rights to be the beneficiary on your retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies –- even though your divorce decree might say that your former spouse has waived all rights to the benefits,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You will need to formally submit a change of beneficiary form to each financial institution. Otherwise, the benefit will be paid to whoever is listed on their forms at the time of your death &ndash; regardless of your divorce.&rdquo; Take this opportunity to reflect on the people in your life that are around to support you and encourage you. This can be a hard step, changing your beneficiary, because you&rsquo;ve never imagined having to remove your spouse. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want to revise your will, says Cheswick. &ldquo;Meet with an estate planning attorney to discuss your state’s laws regarding possible updates to your will, power of attorney and advanced directives,&rdquo; she suggests. &ldquo;You want to be sure that your former spouse is no longer entitled to any distribution in the event of your death. And if your settlement agreement requires one party to maintain life insurance on the other, then there needs to be a method in place to be sure this is actually occurring. Just because the former spouse says they will do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are following through.&rdquo; <strong>Emergency Funds</strong> When you and your spouse were married, you knew you could rely on each other if one of you lost your job, had a medical emergency, or if something in the house needed immediate repair. But now if anything unexpected pops up, you&rsquo;re going to alone. This can be scary. But if you&rsquo;re smart about it, and plan for it, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Sachs recommends, to help protect yourself, create an emergency fund that you continue adding to whenever you have the chance. &ldquo;An emergency fund should equal three to six months of your living expenses,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If you can swing it, I recommend six months because you&rsquo;re now single and need an even bigger cushion if you are not able to work or an emergency occurs.&rdquo; <strong>Really Finalize</strong> Even though the divorce papers are signed an finalized, according to Cheswick, your work isn&rsquo;t really complete until you&rsquo;ve ensured the assets awarded in the settlement have been distributed. This means doing your due diligence and following up with your spouse and all the shared accounts that you used to have. If the information and assets have not been transferred to you, you will need to ensure that they are. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of people who will contact me months (and unfortunately even years) after their divorce is finalized and there are still outstanding items which have not been resolved,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Remember that the agreement is a legally binding contract that you both signed and agreed to uphold. If one party is failing to comply with the terms of the contract then the other party has every right to take steps to ensure their compliance including going back to court to have the agreement enforced.&rdquo; .&quot; <strong>You Still Need to Plan for Retirement</strong> As the divorce gets closer to being finalized, Sachs advises looking to ways of maximizing your retirement savings. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let divorce stop you from planning for your future,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Investing in your 401K plan will allow you to save for retirement. You can begin by saving a small amount each week and then let it build slowly or make payroll contributions that match your employer contributions. Don&rsquo;t stop thinking of the future!&rdquo; Just because you are no longer going to be sharing your golden years with your ex-spouse, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have the time of your life. Getting your financial situation under control is the first step to taking back your life and claiming your bright future.</p>
<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
<p>After your divorce is finalized you&rsquo;ll be able to reclaim your life and do things you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. Follow whatever it is that your heart desires. By doing so you are offering yourself to the world and finding your own unique way that makes you feel alive. You can choose to stay shut in by the pain of loss and old wounds, but remember that the world will continue to turn. Don&rsquo;t you want to be a part of it?</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court.

<p>Either parent is able to dispute <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/" title="San Diego Paternity Lawyer">paternity</a>. Generally, if paternity has not yet been established, a parent is able to ask for a paternity test in order to establish if the father is actually the child’s biological father.</p>
<h2 id="paternity">Paternity</h2>
<p>Under California law, the word &ldquo;paternity&rdquo; is used interchangeably with &ldquo;parentage&rdquo; and &ldquo;parental relationship.&rdquo; Laws regarding paternity are complicated. For example, if a court order has already determined someone is the father of the child, and he or the mother of the child wants genetic (DNA) testing, it might be too late to do so, due to the court order. A court order might also determine someone to be the legal father despite the genetic test proving he is not the biological father.</p>
<h3 id="paternity-assumption">Paternity Assumption</h3>
<p>Establishing paternity means either the courts or parents of the child have determined who the father is. The law assumes paternity under these instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>the husband of the mother is presumed to be the child&rsquo;s father when the child is born during a marriage.</li>
<li>if a man has been living with the child and the mother in a &ldquo;family-like&rdquo; manner, the man has demonstrated he is committed to the child, and even if he is not the biological father, he is still presumed to be the child&rsquo;s father.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these two things are not the case, then paternity needs to be established.</p>
<h3 id="paternity-testing">Paternity Testing</h3>
<p>Establishing paternity is helpful when it comes to providing financial support and health insurance for the child. it&rsquo;s also important to establish paternity if there are ever legal issues surrounding child support and child visitation. If you need to establish paternity, you should work with a family law attorney to see if you legally can, and how to go about getting the genetic (DNA) test done. For advice on <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/" title="San Diego Paternity Lawyer">paternity</a>, you need the expert law firm of <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="San Diego Divorce &amp; Family Law Lawyer">(619) DIVORCE</a>, APC. Schedule a consultation today.</p>
<h2 id="child-support">Child Support</h2>
<p>, and you receive a petition for child support, you respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-a-child-support-petition">Receiving a Child Support Petition</h2>
<p>Once you receive a child support petition, you must follow the instructions on that petition. This often means you will need to appear in court on a specific date. During the court hearing, a judge will examine your income, the other parent&rsquo;s income, how much time the child spends with each parent, as well as any special circumstances regarding daycare or medical expenses, and then determine how much you will pay in child support.</p>
<h2 id="child-support-hearing">Child Support Hearing</h2>
<p>To prepare for the child support hearing, you need to put together and bring the following to court: evidence of your income and any other court requested documents. If you do not believe you are the father of the child, and you have not been legally stated as the father, you are able to request a paternity test. If this request is accepted, the child will need to submit to the test before you are required to make child support payments.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-appear-or-pay">Failure to Appear or Pay</h3>
<p>If you do not appear at the child support hearing or do not make child support payments as ordered by the court, then the court can take measures to collect the unpaid payments. This might mean garnishing your wages, suspension of your driver&rsquo;s license, or over legal actions, such as jail time and fines.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>Co-parenting can be very difficult - especially if you are not fond of the person you are expected to co-parent with. This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Here are some steps you can follow: <strong>Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</strong> In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse. <strong>Step Two is to Set Boundaries</strong> The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Here are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side while scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for the behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other of any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Divorce can turn friends into enemies. A better and less stressful solution might be a <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">collaborative divorce</a>. It can also save couples time and money. If you&rsquo;re considering divorce, you should consider collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-collaborative-divorce">What is a Collaborative Divorce?</h2>
<p>A collaborative divorce includes a team of four people: a lawyer for each spouse, a mental health coach, and a financial professional. They all work together to create a divorce agreement which includes alimony, the division of marital property, and child visitation and support. A collaborative divorce is a face-to-face litigation process where each spouse gives their opinion in order to reach emotional as well as financial and legal solutions. &ldquo;The rewards of collaborative divorce are huge,&rdquo; according to attorney Joryn Jenkins. &ldquo;You learn to work out issues and say things in a better way.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="a-collaborative-divorce-is-shorter-and-costs-less">A Collaborative Divorce is Shorter and Costs Less</h3>
<p>A collaborative divorce may save you both time and money. While a regular divorce that goes to a trial may cost $100,000, the average collaborative divorce is about $32,000. In addition to less money, the average collaborative divorce lasts three to four months to settle compared to a divorce trial that can drag on for years. Because a judge makes the final decision in a trial dtheree, thise isn&rsquo;t much control when it comes to the process, timing, or outcome of the case. &ldquo;People are raiding their retirement accounts just to pay for divorces,&rdquo; said collaborative attorney Rackham Karlsson. &ldquo;Going to court can be more expensive, more time intensive and corrosive for children.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="collaborative-divorce-a-good-alternative">Collaborative Divorce a Good Alternative</h3>
<p>If a couple can work through their divorce by doing a collaborative divorce compared to a standard one, they save time and money, as well as lots of headaches.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward-after-divorce">Moving Forward After Divorce</h2>
<p>Divorce can be a painful process, and a painful one to heal from. After your divorce is finalized, it&rsquo;s time to move forward. Here are some tips for self-care after divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Change Your Diet Up</li>
<li>Eat Healthy Foods</li>
<li>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule</li>
<li>Get Sunshine</li>
<li>Network of Support</li>
<li>Try to Relax</li>
<li>Practice Mindfulness</li>
<li>Consider Getting Help Using a Therapist or Mental Health Professional</li>
<li>Hold Off on Having Another Relationship</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="options-instead-of-divorce">Options Instead of Divorce</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re debating if you should get divorced or not, there are additional options for you to consider.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-and-annulment">Legal Separation and Annulment</h3>
<p>You might not need to file for divorce. There are two other options: legal separation or <em>annulment</em> (also called a <em>nullity</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal separation</strong>. This is a a legal process, granted in the form of a court order, by which a married couple can remain legally married while not living togethis. Some couples use this as a formal break, during which they have some time to decide if they would like to continue the marriage. Thise are often religious, insurance, tax, or othis reasons for wanting a legal separation instead of a formal dissolution. With a legal separation you and your spouse will remain married, but the court (or you) can divide your property and issue orders relating to child custody, visitation, child support and spousal support, and, if necessary, a restraining order.</li>
<li><strong>Annulment</strong>. Being granted an annulment makes it as if your marriage never existed. Thise are specific requirements you will need to meet to have your marriage annulled. These include being a minor without the consent of your parents or guardian during the time of the marriage, or if certain types of fraud or deceit were involved. An annulment requires you appear in court.</li>
</ul>
<p>The residency requirements for these are less harsh than standard divorces. Eithis of these can be obtained without having lived in California for six months or the county you are filing in for three months prior to filing, as is required for a standard divorce.</p>
<h3 id="summary-dissolution">Summary Dissolution</h3>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">In California</a> you are able to receive a simplified dissolution of marriage if you meet certain requirements. This is called a _summary dissolutio_n. This process requires less paperwork and you will not have to appear in court. You are eligible for a summary dissolution if you and your spouse have agreed in writing to a division of your assets and debts and if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been married for five years or less.</li>
<li>You have no children from the relationship.</li>
<li>Neithis of you own a home or othis real estate.</li>
<li>The value of all community property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>The value of eithis party&rsquo;s separate property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>Your combined debt does not exceed $4,000, except for auto loans.</li>
<li>Both of you waive spousal support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both spouses agree to these terms, you can be granted a summary dissolution. This process can be as easy as filling out a form and turning it in to your local clerk&rsquo;s office. Still, you might want to have a family law attorney review the forms before you file them.</p>
<h3 id="amount-of-time">Amount of Time</h3>
<p>In California, the mandatory waiting period required is 6 months. No couple, regardless of how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; their divorce is can be divorced faster than 6 months. This is the time it takes for the state to change your status from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to single&quot;.  You will be able to get all your paperwork turned in to the court and your divorce judgment approved, but the divorce itself will not be final until at least 6 months after the initial petition. In some cases, those that require a lot of things to be required, a divorce can take years. This is based on how much you decided to disagree and agree on. </p>

<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody</a> cases can get combative. Typically, both parents want equal time with their children. But all too often a parent will try to argue that the other parent isn&rsquo;t fit to raise a child. Here are some things you can do to protect yourself when entering a litigious custody case. It&rsquo;s important to remember that most courts will want to reward joint custody. If that happens in your case, it will be up to you to create a livable co-parenting relationship.</p>
<h2 id="when-child-custody-becomes-war">When Child Custody Becomes War</h2>
<p>When resolving custody cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the other parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the other parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the other parent</li>
<li>If the other parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the other parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions. Being able to remove any emotions you have about the other parent will help you stay focused on creating an unbiased record. State the facts and try to keep the emotions out of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>
<p>Using a spiral notebook, Excel document, or any other form that will help you keep track of every interaction, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Times of calls or visits</li>
<li>Topics discussed (either between you or the other spouse or between the other spouse and your child or children). This does not have to mean an invasion of privacy, but if you&rsquo;re able to get a gauge of what was discussed between your child or children and the other parent it only builds a stronger case</li>
<li>Duration of phone call or visit</li>
<li>Was the interaction spontaneous or part of a pre-arranged visitation schedule?</li>
<li>How the child or children felt prior to the visit or call, as well as after</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionaltips"> <strong>Additional Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent in your record keeping. If that means setting a daily time to record anything that has happened, then do so. Waiting days or weeks to record an interaction will make it difficult for you to remember specifics.</li>
<li>Be neutral! Try to not let emotion get ahold of you.</li>
<li>Research your state laws regarding auto recordings and telephone calls. In some jurisdictions, recording conversations is illegal.</li>
<li>Work with a lawyer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-your-child-testify">Should Your Child Testify?</h2>
<p>get litigious you want to pull out all the stops to make your case. You might be tempted to have your child testify. This can be especially tempting if your child has expressed that they would want to be with you full time. But before you move forward with allowing your child to testify, there are some things you should consider.</p>
<h3 id="considerations-before-hearing">Considerations Before Hearing</h3>
<p>Here are some things you&rsquo;ll want to consider: <strong>Is it necessary for your child to testify?</strong> And what are your reasons behind why you want your child to provide testimony? Will your child be able to provide the judge with information regarding his or his home life and how the current custody arrangement is impacting them? Is your child mature enough to express his or his desires? If your reasoning behind having your child provide testimony is field by revenge or wanting to embarrass your spouse, then you should refrain. But if your reasoning is fueled by fear of the child&rsquo;s life being endangered by living with the othis parent, then you should let them testify. <strong>What are the effects this will have?</strong> Divorce and being shuffled between two homes is already a tough experience for a child to go through. Will testifying make your child feel as if they have to choose sides? How will this make them feel? How will this impact your relationship with them? How would you feel if they were testifying against you? Co-parenting is a large part of this &ldquo;new world&rdquo; your child is in, and you should encourage a healthy co-parenting environment. If your child has expressed in interest in testifying, try to get behind the real reasons. Are they just afraid they will lose time with you? Do they just need some reassurance? What are the testimony laws in your state? A divorce and family law attorney will be able to help you understand the child testimony laws in your state. In California, a child 14 years or older is allowed to testify during divorce proceedings, unless the testimony is not in the &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; of that child. A court will also consider the testimony of a child under the age of 14 if that child is deemed mature enough to be able to provide a competent testimony.</p>
<h3 id="final-advice">Final Advice</h3>
<p>The decision of allowing your son or daughter to provide testimony should not be taken lightly. You should with the pros and cons of the situation, and really listen to your child&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask the tough questions of yourself and of your child to get to the bottom of what they impact this testimony will have. Keeping your child&rsquo;s best interest in mind will help steer your decision to the one that is correct for you and your child.</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody">Joint Custody</h2>
<p>to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that kids respond best to both parents being in their lives. Joint custody is when two parents share decision-making responsibilities and/or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living together, or even if they never lived together.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Custody</strong></h3>
<p>There are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-co-parenting-relationship">Creating a Co-Parenting Relationship</h2>
<p>If you have gone to court for custody, and the court decided to award joint custody, chances are there will be a number of issues you and your ex-spouse will need to work through. If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. If you&rsquo;re newly <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorced</a>, right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be placed in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>There are certain things that any child will need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>

<p>Co-parenting is difficult, but it can be even harder during the upcoming months. With Halloween, Thanksgiving, and then Christmas, Hannukah, and all the other family gatherings, it can be incredibly hard to determine how your child will be spending the most important days of the year. But what can parents do to offset the negative impact of <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> especially during an already stressful holiday season? The answer: find ways to create a successful co-parenting relationship.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting-during-the-next-few-months">Co-Parenting During the Next Few Months</h2>
<p>The holiday season is all about shuffling back and forth - from parties to shopping centers, to homes, to friends&rsquo; homes. If this was difficult to accomplish as a married couple, it can be even harder to accomplish as a divorced co-parenting team. During the holiday season, it&rsquo;s all about the pre-schedule. But before we get to that, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about what &ldquo;co-parenting&rdquo; means.</p>
<h3 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h3>
<p>When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is a totally new and different lifestyle, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. This goes for newly divorced parents, as well as parents that have been divorced and co-parenting for years.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hie are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, there are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are together, try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachis conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to each othis and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say &ldquo;please&rdquo; and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements-and-holidays">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements and Holidays</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays and every event that happens during the holidays. This means creating a holiday season schedule. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. There are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>While the idea of signing a prenuptial agreement feels unromantic to most couples, the feelings associated with not signing a prenup, and then facing <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, might be worse. Below we discuss why you really should consider signing a prenup.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-really-need-a-prenup">Do You Really Need a Prenup?</h2>
<p>Not signing a prenuptial divorce can be a costly mistake - and one that could cost you half of what you own. Typically prenups are an important consideration for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>older couples (because they typically have acquired assets);</li>
<li>those who come into a marriage with assets;</li>
<li>people who have children from prior relationships;</li>

<h2 id="prenuptial-agreements-for-everyone">Prenuptial Agreements for Everyone</h2>
<p>But prenups aren&rsquo;t just for the super-rich. As Joslin Davis, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, explains, creating a prenuptial agreement — or for unmarried couples, a cohabitation agreement — can make sense for many people. &ldquo;It requires people to think ahead,&rdquo; she said. Young couples can also benefit from the creation of a prenuptial agreement because it provides them a chance to plan out issues like paying off one partner&rsquo;s student-loan debt, or compensation for leaving the workforce to care for their future children.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-mistakes-in-a-prenuptial-agreement">Avoid Mistakes in a Prenuptial Agreement</h3>
<p>If there are mistakes in a prenuptial agreement it can be declared invalid, which can cause much greater headaches should your marriage turn to divorce. Some common mistakes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same Legal Representation – Both spouses need separate attorneys to ensure each understands the prenuptial agreement independently of the other. This ensures the signing of the final prenuptial agreement is voluntary, without one spouse feeling as if they are being pressured into signing it.</li>
<li>Signed Under Duress – If one party feels pressured into signing the prenuptial agreement, or if they were influenced by drugs or alcohol affecting their mental capacity, it can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Signed Too Soon Before the Wedding - Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to sign the prenuptial agreement. If the couple divorces soon after the wedding, an argument that one party was coerced into signing can be argued. The prenuptial agreement should be signed one to three months before the wedding to give the spouse sufficient time to think about and consider what they are signing.</li>
<li>No Full Disclosure – Make sure the prenuptial agreement discloses all assets and debts.</li>
<li>Child Support Provisions – Do not include child custody or support. If the couple divorces and children are involved, the court will rule in whatever is the best interests of the child and not what was in the prenuptial agreement. If child custody and support are included the whole prenuptial agreement can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Biased - If the prenuptial agreement seems biased towards one spouse party, it can be decided it&rsquo;s unenforceable or “unconscionable.”</li>
<li>Unenforceable Provisions – If a prenuptial agreement has unusual provisions, such as who does the dishes or takes out the garbage, they can be deemed unenforceable, which will weaken it.</li>
<li>Oral Agreement – A prenuptial agreement should be in written and multiple copies made. Each spouse and spouse&rsquo;s attorney should have a copy of the prenuptial agreement.</li>
<li>Ambiguous Writing – If anything is unclear, or there is ambiguous wording, the prenuptial agreement can be challenged in court.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marital-property-division">Marital Property Division</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to do everything you can to protect yourself financially. Doing so means completely understanding <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhabited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution, property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the higher wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. You&rsquo;ll want to work with a divorce attorney in the state in which you are divorcing so they can help advise you on your state&rsquo;s specific laws regarding property division.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case, you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>

<p>Chris Pratt and Anna Faris have officially finalized their divorce. The two signed the divorce papers with a private judge.</p>
<h2 id="chris-pratt-and-anna-faris-are-officially-divorced">Chris Pratt and Anna Faris are Officially Divorced</h2>
<p>The couple announced their decision to separate in December 2017, after 9 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. The two were wed in July 2009. Pratt and Faris share 6-year-old son Jack, who they will continue to co-parent, with each having joint custody. Faris filed her response shortly after Pratt and also asked for joint custody and the right to receive child support.  The two had a prenuptial agreement.</p>
<p>“Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed,” the couple said in a joint statement on Aug. 6, 2017. They added, “Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.”</p>
<h2 id="met-on-set">Met on Set</h2>
<p>Pratt and Faris met on the set of <em>Take Me Home Tonight</em> in 2007 and got engaged just a year later. They were married in summer 2009. Faris opened up about her separation last year, saying, “We’ll always have each other and be incredible friends. There is still so much laughter in our lives together, and he is so proud of me, still.”</p>
<p>She added, “We watched each other grow, and he still cracks me up all the time. And I think I crack him up — unless he’s a <em>really</em> good actor and great at faking laughter.” Pratt and Faris have both moved on with new relationships. Faris has been dating cinematographer Michael Barrett. Pratt has been linked to Katherine Schwarzenegger.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>While every divorce is different, there are some common steps of the divorce process. Remember that state laws vary, and the particulars of your situation will need to be taken into account. This information is meant as a general overview of what the divorce process is. You&rsquo;ll want to consult with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">family law attorney</a> on the specifics of your case. The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce. In fact, there are various forms of divorce available (of course, you will need to ensure your state laws regarding these types of divorce), including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce.  <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce. <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involved a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations, and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-divorce-process">Starting the Divorce Process</h2>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>

<p>For parents that are figuring out their co-parenting schedule, Halloween can be a tough one. Every parent wants to share in the joy of Halloween night. Maybe you&rsquo;ve decided to be the one to go to the kid&rsquo;s school party while the other parent takes your child trick-or-treating. Or vice versa. Maybe you and your co-parent are civil enough to share in the day and the trick-or-treating night. Regardless of your situation, Halloween can prove to be a challenge.</p>
<h2 id="are-you-ready-for-halloween-co-parenting">Are You Ready for Halloween Co-Parenting?</h2>
<p>When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is a totally new and different lifestyle, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. This goes for newly divorced parents, as well as parents that have been divorced and co-parenting for years.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side where scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, there are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are together try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teacher conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each other and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or other important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements-and-holidays">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements and Holidays</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays and every event that happens during the holidays. This means creating a holiday season schedule. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. There are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Mandy Moore has plans to marry singer Taylor Goldsmith at the end of the year, and in a recent interview revealed that she didn&rsquo;t choose the &ldquo;right person&rdquo; the first time around when she chose to marry singer Ryan Adams in 2009. The pair separated in 2015 and were divorced in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="mandy-moore-moves-on">Mandy Moore Moves On</h2>
<p>When the <em>This is Us</em> star wed Ryan Adams in 2009 it was during a pretty tumultuous personal time. Moore&rsquo;s mother had just left her father after 30 years of marriage, for a woman. “I couldn’t control what happened to my immediate family, but I could control starting my own,” she says of deciding to get married. “Not the smartest decision. I didn’t choose the right person.” “I don’t feel guilty for it. I don’t fault myself for it,” she says of her divorce. “When people said, ‘I’m sorry,’ I was like, ‘No. Sorry would have been had I stayed in a very unhealthy situation.’ I didn’t. I found my way out. And when I did, things opened back up again.” Moore started dating another musician Taylor Goldsmith while still dealing with the emotions of her divorce from Adams. “I was still dealing with the trauma of my divorce when we started dating,” she says. “Taylor was steadfast in his support—that was a huge sign for me.”</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-amarriage">The End of a Marriage</h3>
<p>There is nothing easy about ending a marriage. You&rsquo;re going to feel out of place for a while. Everything is new. Chances are you&rsquo;ve had to rearrange your schedule to now pick up the kids from their dad&rsquo;s house every other weekend. It might mean you&rsquo;re not spending Christmas with your parents so that the children can spend Hanukkah with their mom&rsquo;s family. You might need to set up an automatic child support and spousal support payment to your ex-husband for every third week of the month. Or maybe you need to call your now ex-wife to make sure that she drops off the soccer cleats at the school that your son left at his house over the weekend. Regardless of what the situation is, things have changed. And that means your financial situation has. But just because everything is different, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should steer your course for financial ruin. Yes, losing a second income is hard. It can be especially hard if you were living off of one income and now have to go back to the land of the full-time worker. These are some tips and tricks that can help ensure that your divorce doesn&rsquo;t translate to financial ruin.</p>
<h2 id="gather-resources">Gather Resources</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go it alone,&rdquo; says Mike Lynch, vice president of strategic markets at Hartford Funds. &ldquo;Build a team today – a qualified team of legal, tax and investment professionals. Maybe it&rsquo;s your current investment professional, or you may seek a new one that understands your situation better.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re going to want to put together a legal team to help you reach a settlement in regards to child custody and property division. But you might also want to consider bringing on a team of financial professionals to advise you on things such as how your taxes will need to be filed (Alimony and child support can have large financial impact), in addition to how to make money work for you now that there is only you to help pay the bills.</p>
<h2 id="specifics-to-keep-in-mind">Specifics To Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>Certified divorce financial analyst Eva Sachs, Emily McBurney, an attorney and qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO) expert, and certified divorce financial analyst Donna Cheswick also have this advice:</p>
<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<p>Sachs says the first step toward financial independence is balancing your income with your expenses. This can be hard to do if you&rsquo;ve never had to in the past. He advises you sit down and look at how much money is coming in from various avenues like work, alimony and/or child support payments, and then assess how much of that is going toward living expenses. &ldquo;Think of it as a spending plan rather than a budget,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Knowing where your money goes is key, especially after divorce. There will be many new expenses you might not have thought about prior to your divorce; this is a critical time to refrain from spending money you don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; <strong>Change Your Benefactors</strong> Most likely your spouse was your main benefactor during the marriage, but that is probably not going to be the case moving forward. To remedy this, one of the first things you need to do is update the beneficiary on your life insurance and retirement accounts. &ldquo;Review all of your accounts and insurance policies and change the beneficiaries. A divorce does <em>not</em> automatically terminate your former spouse’s rights to be the beneficiary on your retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies –- even though your divorce decree might say that your former spouse has waived all rights to the benefits,&rdquo; says McBurney. &ldquo;You will need to formally submit a change of beneficiary form to each financial institution. Otherwise, the benefit will be paid to whoever is listed on their forms at the time of your death &ndash; regardless of your divorce.&rdquo; Take this opportunity to reflect on the people in your life that are around to support you and encourage you. This can be a hard step, changing your beneficiary, because you&rsquo;ve never imagined having to remove your spouse. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want to revise your will, says Cheswick. &ldquo;Meet with an estate planning attorney to discuss your state’s laws regarding possible updates to your will, power of attorney and advanced directives,&rdquo; she suggests. &ldquo;You want to be sure that your former spouse is no longer entitled to any distribution in the event of your death. And if your settlement agreement requires one party to maintain life insurance on the other, then there needs to be a method in place to be sure this is actually occurring. Just because the former spouse says they will do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are following through.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="property-division">Property Division</h3>
<p>Marital property division is governed by state laws, but can still get contentious. You will need to check with a family law attorney to see if you live in an equitable distribution state or a community property state. There are four steps to dividing marital property:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify assets owned by you and the assets owned by your spouse</li>
<li>Categorize all assets as &ldquo;marital&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; property (an attorney can help you determine this)</li>
<li>Assign a value to each asset (you might need an appraiser for this)</li>
<li>Devise a plan for the division of assets that is in accordance with state laws</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consider-selling-shared-property">Consider Selling Shared Property</h3>
<p>Instead of fighting over who will retain ownership of the family property, consider selling it and splitting the proceeds. This is a way for each spouse to &ldquo;break even.&rdquo; When it comes to a secondary home, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much more effective to sell the house and distribute the proceeds to the children,&rdquo; says Ric Edelman, chairman and CEO of Edelman Financial Services. &ldquo;You get into the issue of fights amongst the kids – issues of maintenance, repairs, and upkeep.&rdquo;  after their divorce is finalized and there are still outstanding items which have not been resolved,&quot; she said. &ldquo;Remember that the agreement is a legally binding contract that you both signed and agreed to uphold. If one party is failing to comply with the terms of the contract then the other party has every right to take steps to ensure their compliance including going back to court to have the agreement enforced.&rdquo; <strong>Plan for Retirement</strong> As the divorce gets closer to being finalized, Sachs advises looking to ways of maximizing your retirement savings. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let divorce stop you from planning for your future,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Investing in your 401K plan will allow you to save for retirement. You can begin by saving a small amount each week and then let it build slowly or make payroll contributions that match your employer contributions. Don&rsquo;t stop thinking of the future!&rdquo; Just because you are no longer going to be sharing your golden years with your ex-spouse, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have the time of your life. Getting your financial situation under control is the first step to taking back your life and claiming your bright future.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>A wedding ring is a symbol of marriage, not <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">divorce</a>. So what happens to those rings when a couple decides to end their marriage?</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-to-the-wedding-ring">What Happens to the Wedding Ring?</h2>
<p>A wedding ring, specifically if it was purchased by both spouse&rsquo;s, can become a bit of a sticking point when it comes to a divorce. There are a few options that people consider - leaving it for a child, having it appraised and sold, or just keeping them. Either way, you will want to work with a family law attorney to decide what the best and most beneficial option may be. A family law attorney might consider having it appraised so that both spouses are aware of how much of an asset the rings are. In addition to figuring out what will be done with the rings, there are other aspects of a marriage that will need to be determined.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-preparation">Divorce Preparation</h2>
<h3 id="consult-an-family-law-attorneyhttps619divorcecomfamily-law-attorney">Consult an <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">Family Law Attorney</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that you are completely aware of your legal rights and responsibilities when you start the divorce process. A family law attorney can help advise you on everything related to divorce: the paperwork, child custody arrangements, spousal support, and how marital property will be divided. You&rsquo;ll want to consult an attorney at every step of the process to make sure that you are protected.</p>
<h3 id="copy-legal-documents">Copy Legal Documents</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts of divorce is the paperwork. You&rsquo;ll want to make sure you have everything, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> tax returns,</li>
<li>bank statements,</li>
<li>investment statements,</li>
<li>retirement account statements,</li>
<li>employee benefits handbooks,</li>
<li>life insurance policies,</li>
<li>mortgage documents,</li>
<li>financial statements,</li>
<li>credit card statements,</li>
<li>wills,</li>
<li>Social Security statements,</li>
<li>automobile titles,</li>
<li>joint accounts like phones and utilities,</li>
<li>any joint business venture information</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to ensure that you have copies of any financial data, whether it be electronic or physical copies. Making sure you have all this information will make the process much quicker.</p>
<h3 id="inventory-household-and-possessions">Inventory Household and Possessions</h3>
<p>Property division is a big aspect of the agreement process of divorce. Major assets include homes, furniture, artwork, jewelry, and appliances. Property is decided according to your state&rsquo;s specific laws. This has the potential to be very litigious during a divorce.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inherited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highest wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case, you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-current-household-budget-and-expenses">Know Your Current Household Budget and Expenses</h3>
<p>Preparing for divorce is knowing how your household money is currently being handled. Often times this means that only one spouse is fully aware of the couple&rsquo;s financial picture. If you are planning for a divorce, it is pertinent that you understand your household&rsquo;s financial picture, including the amount that goes towards utilities, mortgages, and typical household expenses. Getting a better idea of how much is spent every month currently will also help you prepare for when you are budgeting and managing your household after the divorce.</p>
<h3 id="determine-debts">Determine Debts</h3>
<p>If you and your spouse have racked up a considerable amount of debt during your marriage, you will have to determine what happens to that debt during divorce. If you are able to, it&rsquo;s advised that you pay down as much debt as possible prior to divorcing. Allocation of marital debt among divorcing spouses can be one of the most difficult items to negotiate. You&rsquo;ll also want to have an idea of what your debts were like prior to the marriage - so any debt that would be considered “non-marital debt.” This can include student loans and any other lines of credit that were not transferred over during the marriage. This debt belongs to the spouse who incurred it.</p>
<h3 id="know-what-your-spouse-earns">Know What Your Spouse Earns</h3>
<p>For most couples, this information is available simply by looking at a pay-stub. For couples where one spouse is self-employed or owns a business, or receives any portion of income in cash, it can be hard to determine. If this information is not available to you, try to keep track of money that is flowing in. If you are suspicious of your spouse&rsquo;s spending habits, you&rsquo;ll want to try to get as much information as possible. You can also work with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">family law attorney</a> to figure out how to obtain this information in a legal way.</p>
<h3 id="get-a-job">Get a Job</h3>
<p>There is a chance that you or your spouse are not employed. Sometimes one spouse will remain at home to take care of the family, while the other spouse supports the family. If you have been out of the workforce for a while, you will need to assess your employability. Will you be able to obtain a job easily or will you need further education or training?</p>
<h3 id="know-your-credit-history">Know Your Credit History</h3>
<p>Do you know what your current credit score is? If not, then you need to find out. Divorce can impact this, and you&rsquo;ll want to know what your score is so you can plan accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="start-saving">Start Saving</h3>
<p>Once your divorce is finalized, your financial picture will be completely up to you. That means it will all be on your shoulders. It&rsquo;s important that you be able to support your family. This might mean saving some money now.</p>
<h3 id="put-your-kids-first">Put your Kids First</h3>
<p>Divorce can be very hard on children. If you and your spouse cannot agree to child custody arrangements, you will need to find a way to make it work. A family law attorney can help with this.</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-the-divorce-process">Steps for the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>

<p>Gwyneth Paltrow, who famously &ldquo;uncoupled&rdquo; from ex Chris Martin in 2014, has now officially &ldquo;coupled&rdquo; with television producer Brad Falchuk. The couple was married in late September.</p>
<h2 id="gwyneth-paltrow-re-couples">Gwyneth Paltrow &ldquo;Re-Couples&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Paltrow, 46, and Falchuk first met in 2010 on the set of &ldquo;Glee,&rdquo; which Falchuk co-created and on which Paltrow guest starred. The couple just wed in a secret, yet star-studded wedding, at the end of September.</p>
<p>Paltrow announced her engagement to Falchuk in an interview in her magazine Goop in the January issue. During that interview, Paltrow described Falchuk as the &ldquo;man I was meant to be with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally, at midlife, I have tried to accept how complex romantic love can be,&rdquo; she said of their relationship. &ldquo;I have decided to give it a go again, not only because I believe I have found the man I was meant to be with, but because I have accepted the soul-stretching, pattern-breaking opportunities that (terrifyingly) are made possible by intimacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is Paltrow&rsquo;s second marriage.</p>
<p>She and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin were married for 11 years and have two children together, Apple and Moses.</p>
<p>Falchuk, 47, also has two children from a previous marriage.</p>
<h2 id="self-care-during-divorce-how-to">Self Care During Divorce: How-To</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">Divorce</a> is not only a difficult time in a person&rsquo;s life, but it can also be emotionally traumatic. The relationship with your spouse and the structure of your lives that you helped establish in what you thought would be a happily-ever-after marriage has ended. What are the next steps and the things that will help you get back that feeling you call &ldquo;normal&rdquo;? Although you may not realize it, there are some things you can do to get back there. According to Natalie Greggs, a family law attorney from Allen, Texas, “Self-care is the number one thing that gets you through the day.” Though she is a family law attorney and not a therapist, she advises clients that self-care is the best method to get them through this rough time.</p>
<h3 id="self-care-is-future-well-being">Self-Care is Future Well-Being</h3>
<p>Self-care is more than just a way to get through each day while you go through your divorce. Self-care is also crucial for the well-being of your future as well. Numerous studies indicate that stress is a cause of long-term health problems. Research also indicates that individuals going through a divorce have a heightened risk for some long-term chronic health problems. This research is even scarier when faced with the fact that experts mention that 40-50% of all marriages end in divorce.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-sane-during-your-divorce">Keeping Sane During Your Divorce</h3>
<p>Here are some self-care tips to practice while you go through a divorce: <strong>Exercise.</strong>  Even if you&rsquo;re not going through a divorce, exercise is good for you. For people going through traumatic times, it is especially helpful. Exercise encourages your body to produce endorphins, a feel-good chemical for the brain. Certified integrative nutrition coach and personal trainer Lindsay Hunt, says exercise also helps increase self-confidence, improves sleep, reduces anxiety symptoms, and reduces stress and depression. Any form involving physical movement is helpful such as walking, dancing, swimming, and yoga. The trick is to find something you really enjoy doing. That way chances are you&rsquo;ll want to keep doing it often and on a regular basis. Another tip is to find a friend or &ldquo;workout buddy&rdquo; to help encourage you to get off that couch and get moving. They can also encourage you be holding you accountable for getting up and out. <strong>Change Your Diet Up.</strong> When people are faced with emotional issues it can cause you to lose and/or gain weight. Divorce can increase these ups and down, making them go out of control. You can go from one extreme to another, from completely restricting meals to binging on unhealthy foods. &ldquo;I had a slender client who, over the course of a year, proceeded to lose probably 50 pounds,&rdquo; remembers Greggs. &ldquo;By the end of his case, she was skeletal.&rdquo; While some may lose weight, others can gain. Mikki Meyer, a licensed marriage and family therapist, said she had a client who ended up gaining almost 100 pounds. Hunt suggests trying to be proactive and preemptive about both diet as well as divorce. Diet has a big part in affecting your mood, which is important during a divorce. Hunt reveals, &ldquo;Eating the right foods may ease depression and calm anxiety.&rdquo; He recommends eating three meals a day consisting of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Having a variety like this helps keep blood sugar levels stable as well as helping to prevent dips leading to cravings. Studies also show that diets high in antioxidants help with depression. So fill that plate high with fruit and veggies. When changing your diet it&rsquo;s best to try avoiding sugar, salty foods, artificial ingredients, excessive caffeine consumption, and especially alcohol. According to studies, dehydration tends to increase stress hormone levels. Because of this, Hunt recommends drinking lots of water.</p>
<h3 id="more-healthy-foods-for-your-brain">More Healthy Foods for Your Brain</h3>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty wild fish such as salmon, and nuts, can help brain function and improves your mood. Steel-cut oatmeal also adds serotonin-boosting complex carbohydrates. It is also a comfort food. If you seem to have trouble eating, you might think about drinking your nutrition. You can make bone broth into a soup that&rsquo;s filled with minerals like magnesium. Your body can easily absorb and helps promotes healthy digestion for upset stomachs. Another way to get nutrition if you have trouble eating is protein shakes. Green vegetable juices are also a good source of nutrition. You can also try taking smaller bites of protein and healthy fats such as eggs, nuts, and avocados. This will help you so you don&rsquo;t lose too much weight. According to Hunt, &ldquo;It is important to feed your body even if you are not hungry, as our immune systems become extremely vulnerable and weak during times of sadness and stress. Finding foods that are comforting and easy to get down is important for your health.&rdquo; <strong>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s hard to return to a normal schedule, it&rsquo;s important to try. Greggs says, &ldquo;Consistency is important for your emotional health. Show up to work on time. Have your routine. Make [yourself] and your children go to bed when you usually go to bed. Don’t act like the divorce is ending your life.&rdquo; <strong>Get Sunshine.</strong> Sunlight boosts vitamin D which your body needs for natural processes and for increasing serotonin levels. Hunt advises, &ldquo;Aim for sunlight every day.&rdquo; Studies indicate at least 15 minutes every day is helpful. <strong>Be Preventative where Your Health is Concerned.</strong> Sociology Professor and director of the Population Research Center Mark Hayward, from the University of Texas—Austin, has researched the long-term health effects and discovered stress from divorce accelerates biological processes that can lead to cardiovascular disease. He has found that divorced, middle-aged women tend to be more likely to develop heart disease compared with non-divorced, middle-aged married women.  503-3050</p>

<p>For couples that have managed to successfully run a business together, it can be difficult to realize that they cannot hold a marriage together. When it comes to running a business with your <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">soon-to-be ex spouse</a>, there are some things you&rsquo;ll need to consider.</p>
<h2 id="separating-business-from-divorce">Separating Business from Divorce</h2>
<p>Just like with marital property, your business will be considered an asset. Like all other aspects of a marriage, including <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">child custody</a> and alimony, there will need to be an agreement made about your shared business. Some couples decide to treat there business as they would a house: either one spouse remains while the other &ldquo;moves out,&rdquo; or they decide to sell the house. Below we discuss what options you&rsquo;ll want to consider when it comes to your shared business.</p>
<h3 id="options-for-shared-business">Options for Shared Business</h3>
<p>Option number one is that the two of you decide to remain as co-owners of the business. Depending on your relationship, this might be a great solve or the worst thing ever. Keep in mind that this will require you to be in constant communication with your ex, even after the divorce is final. If that sounds terrible to you, this option is obviously not advised. Option number two is for one of the spouses to buy out the other spouse. If this is what the both of you decide, then it&rsquo;s advised that you hire a business appraiser to perform a valuation of your company. Once the business is evaluated, you know how much it is worth and one spouse can either buy out the other one, or use other assets for an even exchange. The third option is to sell the business and then split the proceeds. This is often advised for marital property such as homes, and it makes sense in this scenario as both spouses are able to move forward equally, without any past ties remaining. Of course, this might seem an out of the question option if the business is performing well, and both spouses are attached to the business.</p>
<h2 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h2>
<p>In addition to determining what you will do with a shared business, you will also need to understand <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property. Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhibited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the higher wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself-during-marital-property-division">Protecting Yourself During Marital Property Division</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>
<h2 id="financial-planning-for-the-divorce">Financial Planning for the Divorce</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">Divorce</a> is not only an emotional event. It can also mean a shaking up of routine and finances. This is especially true if you have co-owned a business with your spouse and have now decided to sell the business. Knowing that your financial picture will be changing will allow you to prepare for the financial changes that might be coming your way. You&rsquo;ll want to get your finances in order prior to starting the divorce process. This means understanding your assets and their values, as well as what is owned separately and jointly. Next, you&rsquo;ll want to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand what your budget is now, and what it will be following the divorce. What are the big changes? Will you need to make changes?</li>
<li>Get all your bank statements and records together. You&rsquo;ll want to provide this to your attorney.</li>
<li>Get copies of all joint tax returns. This also includes checking that your taxes are up to date.</li>
<li>Do not transfer any jointly owned assets.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t make any large purchases.</li>
<li>Do not agree to distribute any assets until you consult your attorney.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finances-after-divorce">Finances After Divorce</h3>
<p>Your divorce settlement can either mean more money coming your way, or less. Either way, you&rsquo;ll need to create a new plan for it. This might mean you need to take on a job if you didn&rsquo;t have one during the marriage. Any debt you have agreed to take on will now be solely in your name. Make sure that you have both removed the other spouse&rsquo;s name from any agreements or debt contracts. You might also be receiving or paying alimony. If there are children involved, you&rsquo;ll need to understand how much money is allotted to them and for what types of things. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll need to understand the tax laws regarding alimony payments and child support payments. Understanding all of it will make you feel more prepared going into your new situation.</p>
<h2 id="consider-the-mediation-process">Consider the Mediation Process</h2>
<p>, both spouses work with a divorce mediator, who serves as a neutral facilitator, to help the couple come to a mutually agreeable decision regarding their divorce. The mediator will help spouses negotiate division of property, spousal support, and child support and custody. The mediator also does not make any decisions about legal issues, but instead acts as a go-between in the negotiations. Mediation has proven to be successful for couples that are looking to avoid conflict, and also potentially speed up the process of divorce. Here are some things to consider when choosing your mediation lawyer. <strong>Easy and</strong> <strong>Affordable</strong> Divorce mediators often offer flat fees for all of the services they provide. They will also include a free divorce consultation during which you will receive a complete marital estate assessment. The mediator should also help assist with any administrative things such as the filing of the divorce paperwork. Flat fees will allow for you and your spouse to know how much this is going to cost you up front.</p>
<h3 id="a-compassionate-problem-solver">A Compassionate Problem Solver</h3>
<p>Your divorce mediator should be able to offer various options for solving your complex divorce situation. Additionally, your mediator should be invested in you, your family&rsquo;s long-term financial wellness as well as emotional health. If these things aren&rsquo;t clear to you in your first free consultation, you might want to meet with anothis mediator.</p>
<h3 id="focused-on-end-result">Focused on End Result</h3>
<p>Your divorce mediator should be working to ensure that at the end of this process you reach a workable and fair settlement. Focusing on a positive and successful agreement is what your mediator should be doing. One way to gauge this is if your mediator asks whethis you and your spouse agree that the marriage is over and you are each ready to move on. They are only able to find a final agreement if both of you are willing to come to one.</p>
<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
<p>Once your divorce is finalized you&rsquo;ll be able to reclaim your life and do the things you might not have done as a result of your marriage. Do things you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. Follow your heart’s desires. By doing so you are offering yourself to the world and finding your own unique way that makes you feel alive. You can choose to stay shut in by the pain of loss and old wounds, but remember that the world will continue to turn. Don&rsquo;t you want to be a part of it?</p>

<p>Millennials have oft been blamed for ruining things - but now it appears they&rsquo;re going after the divorce rate.</p>
<h2 id="are-millennials-saving-the-divorce-rate">Are Millennials Saving the Divorce Rate?</h2>
<p>According to a new study, it appears millennials may be the reason why the divorce rate is dropping. Philip Cohen of the University of Maryland has found that from 2008 to 2016, the U.S. divorce rate dropped by 18 percent and that &ldquo;The overall drop has been driven entirely by younger women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study notes newly married women are now &ldquo;more likely to be in their first marriages, more likely to have BA degrees or higher education, less likely to be under age 25, and less likely to have own children in the household,&rdquo; which Cohen writes can all impact how likely a couple is to stay together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trends described here represent progress toward a system in which marriage is rarer, and more stable, than it was in the past, representing an increasingly central component of the structure of social inequality,&rdquo; Cohen writes.</p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="divorcehttps619divorcecomsan-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer-san-diego-collaborative-law--divorce-mediation-lawyer"><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">Divorce</a></h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge eithis. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children togethis, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce. In fact, there are various forms of divorce available (of course, you will need to ensure your state laws regarding these types of divorce), including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce.  <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involved a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations, and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce. Regardless of if you want a divorce, want a legal separation, need an annulment, or decide to cancel a divorce like the Dempsey&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s always advised that you work with a divorce attorney.</p>

<p>Is your spouse&rsquo;s video game obsession causing a rift in your marriage? For 200 UK couples, the video game Fortnite is the reason for their divorces.</p>
<h2 id="video-game-fortnite-is-ruining-uk-marriages">Video Game Fortnite is Ruining UK Marriages</h2>
<p>According to Divorce Online, a UK site that offers information and services to people who are divorcing, in 2018 200 people have cited Fortnite as the reason they are getting divorced. Considering the fact that  40 million people log in to play the game every month it goes without saying the game is addictive. It goes without saying that more time online means less time spent with your significant other. Is your marriage on the rocks? Here are a couple of warning signs you&rsquo;ll want to look for. As is always advised, if you are considering divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to work with a family law attorney that can guide you through the divorce process.</p>
<h2 id="signs-your-marriage-is-on-the-rocks">Signs Your Marriage Is On The Rocks</h2>
<p>The following signs could indicate that your marriage needs some help.</p>
<h3 id="youre-not-happy">You&rsquo;re not happy.</h3>
<p>Sure, every relationship has its ups and downs but constantly feeling unhappy is a clear sign that this isn&rsquo;t good anymore.</p>
<h3 id="the-majority-of-your-interactions-are-not-positive">The majority of your interactions are not positive.</h3>
<p>According to marriage researcher John Gottman, happy couples have an interaction ratio of 20:1 — that&rsquo;s 20 positive interactions to 1 negative interaction. Conflicted couples have a ratio of 5:1, and couples nearing divorce are .8:1.</p>
<h3 id="you-create-reasons-to-avoid-your-partner">You create reasons to avoid your partner.</h3>
<p>If you are avoiding your partner or creating reasons to avoid your partner, you should consider talking with a marital therapist. Examples are sitting in the car to avoid going inside your house or wanting to hang out more with friends and family instead of at home.</p>
<h3 id="your-friends-or-family-are-encouraging-you-to-end-the-relationship">Your friends or family are encouraging you to end the relationship.</h3>
<p>Friends and family that are closest to you may be able to see things clearly even when you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="your-instincts-are-telling-youits-over">Your instincts are telling you it&rsquo;s over.</h3>
<p>Is your stomach always in a knot? That might just be your gut instinct telling you it&rsquo;s over. Talking with an expert or therapist who can help you weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<h3 id="you-and-your-spouse-live-like-roommates">You and your spouse live like roommates.</h3>
<p>Does he sleep in one room and you sleep in another room? Are you leading separate lives? Are you okay with it? If so, you&rsquo;ve crossed into roommate zone and you need to decide if you want to continue living that way.</p>
<h3 id="everything-feels-hard">Everything feels hard.</h3>
<p>If every interaction feels like a chore or is painful, like deciding on breakfast or when to go to the grocery store, you&rsquo;ll want to consider if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h3 id="one-or-both-have-changed-values-or-priorities">One or both have changed values or priorities.</h3>
<p>In most good relationships, couples value the same &lsquo;big&rsquo; things. But that can change over time. Often times what one person used to value doesn&rsquo;t&rsquo; matter much over time. Lifestyle changes or job opportunities or even religions can cause people to change. Unless you are both able to adapt, it can be a tough thing to overcome.</p>
<h3 id="sudden-changes-in-behavior">Sudden changes in behavior.</h3>
<p>If one partner suddenly drops lots of weight and takes a renewed interest in their appearance or maybe starts spending a lot of time away from home, you might need to take a closer look into what could be an &lsquo;outside reason&rsquo; for this.</p>
<h2 id="are-these-signs-ringing-a-bell"><strong>Are these signs ringing a bell?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have more than 2-3 of the signs listed above you might want to spend some time to sit down and have an open conversation with your spouse. If that is not possible, you might want to consider speaking with a marital therapist that can advise you on how to have an open conversation with your spouse. If after reading these signs, and you decide that you want a divorce and that there is no way you can work things out with your spouse, you should consider calling a family law attorney.</p>
<h2 id="the-divorce-process">The Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different, and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>

<p>If your friends are divorcing, chances are you might be next. Does a new study show that divorce is contagious?</p>
<h2 id="is-divorce-contagious">Is Divorce Contagious?</h2>
<p>According to a study down at Brown University, Harvard University, and University California, San Diego, divorce can happen in clusters. The study, &ldquo;Breaking Up is Hard to Do, Unless Everyone Else is Doing it Too,&rdquo; found a person is 75 percent more likely to become divorced if a friend has divorced. And if a friend of a friend gets divorced, a person’s odds of getting a divorce increase 33 percent. The study also found that if you&rsquo;re popular, you&rsquo;re more at risk of getting divorced. Still, there&rsquo;s good news for those with children - apparently, children don’t influence the likelihood of divorce according to the study, but having more children could reduce your chances of getting divorced.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-preparation">Divorce Preparation</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something people ever think they&rsquo;ll have to do - prepare for their divorce. But for couples that are headed in that direction, the best thing you can do is be prepared for what is to come. If you&rsquo;re convinced that your marriage will be ending in <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">divorce</a>, and that your relationship with your spouse is irretrievably broken, then you should take some steps in preparation.</p>
<h3 id="consult-afamily-law-attorneyhttps619divorcecomfamily-law-attorney">Consult a <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">Family Law Attorney</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that you are completely aware of your legal rights and responsibilities when you start the divorce process. A family law attorney can help advise you on everything related to divorce: the paperwork, child custody arrangements, spousal support, and how property will be divided. You&rsquo;ll want to consult an attorney at every step of the process to make sure that you are protected.</p>
<h3 id="copy-legal-documents">Copy Legal Documents</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts of divorce is the paperwork. You&rsquo;ll want to make sure you have everything, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> tax returns,</li>
<li>bank statements,</li>
<li>investment statements,</li>
<li>retirement account statements,</li>
<li>employee benefits handbooks,</li>
<li>life insurance policies,</li>
<li>mortgage documents,</li>
<li>financial statements,</li>
<li>credit card statements,</li>

<h3 id="inventory-household-and-possessions">Inventory Household and Possessions</h3>
<p>Property division is a big aspect of the agreement process of divorce. Major assets include: homes, furniture, artwork, jewelry, and appliances. Property is decided according to your state&rsquo;s specific laws. This has the potential to be very litigious during a divorce.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-propertyhttps619divorcecomsan-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer">Separate and Community <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/">Property</a></h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inherited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution, property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highest wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case, you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-current-household-budget-and-expenses">Know Your Current Household Budget and Expenses</h3>
<p>Preparing for divorce is knowing how your household money is currently being handled. Often times this means that only one spouse is fully aware of the couple&rsquo;s financial picture. If you are planning for a divorce, it is pertinent that you understand your household&rsquo;s financial picture, including the amount that goes towards utilities, mortgages, and typical household expenses. Getting a better idea of how much is spent every month currently will also help you prepare for when you are budgeting and managing your household after the divorce.</p>
<h3 id="determine-debts">Determine Debts</h3>
<p>If you and your spouse have racked up a considerable amount of debt during your marriage, you will have to determine what happens to that debt during divorce. If you are able to, it&rsquo;s advised that you pay down as much debt as possible prior to divorcing. Allocation of marital debt among divorcing spouses can be one of the most difficult items to negotiate. You&rsquo;ll also want to have an idea of what your debts were like prior to the marriage - so any debt that would be considered “non-marital debt.” This can include student loans and any other lines of credit that were not transferred over during the marriage. This debt belongs to the spouse who incurred it.</p>
<h3 id="know-what-your-spouse-earns">Know What Your Spouse Earns</h3>
<p>For most couples, this information is available simply by looking at a pay-stub. For couples where one spouse is self-employed or owns a business, or receives any portion of income in cash, it can be hard to determine. If this information is not available to you, try to keep track of money that is flowing in. If you are suspicious of your spouse&rsquo;s spending habits, you&rsquo;ll want to try to get as much information as possible. You can also work with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">family law attorney</a> to figure out how to obtain this information in a legal way.</p>
<h3 id="get-a-job">Get a Job</h3>
<p>There is a chance that you or your spouse are not employed. Sometimes one spouse will remain at home to take care of the family, while the other spouse supports the family. If you have been out of the workforce for a while, you will need to assess your employability. Will you be able to obtain a job easily or will you need further education or training?</p>
<h3 id="know-your-credit-history">Know Your Credit History</h3>
<p>Do you know what your current credit score is? If not, then you need to find out. Divorce can impact this, and you&rsquo;ll want to know what your score is so you can plan accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="start-saving">Start Saving</h3>
<p>Once your divorce is finalized, your financial picture will be completely up to you. That means it will all be on your shoulders. It&rsquo;s important that you be able to support your family. This might mean saving some money now.</p>
<h3 id="put-your-kids-first">Put your Kids First</h3>
<p>Divorce can be very hard on children. If you and your spouse cannot agree to child custody arrangements, you will need to find a way to make it work. A family law attorney can help with this.</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-the-divorce-process">Steps for the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>Angelina Jolie was all smiles over Labor Day weekend, despite the fact that her custody battle is still raging with Brad Pitt.</p>
<h2 id="jolie-all-smiles-despite-custody-battle">Jolie All Smiles Despite Custody Battle</h2>
<p>This past weekend Jolie, 43, was seen in hiking in LA along with daughters Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 10-year-old Vivienne and her twin brother Knox. The two older boys, Maddox, 16, and Pax, 14, were not spotted with the rest of the crew. Jolie and Pitt, 54, have been embattled in a legal dispute over custody of their six children, and just recently had a temporary agreement ordered by the judge. Jolie also recently transitioned to new legal counsel. This past June a judge established a detailed visitation schedule in order to allow Pitt to spend time with the children. Eldest son Maddox was deemed old enough to decide for himself how much time he wants to spend with his father.</p>
<h2 id="when-child-custody-becomes-war">When Child Custody Becomes War</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody</a> cases can get combative. Typically, both parents want equal time with their children. But all too often a parent will try to argue that the other parent isn&rsquo;t fit to raise a child. Here are some things you can do to protect yourself when entering a litigious custody case. It&rsquo;s important to remember that most courts will want to reward joint custody. If that happens in your case, it will be up to you to create a livable co-parenting relationship. When resolving custody cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the other parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the other parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the other parent</li>
<li>If the other parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the other parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions. Being able to remove any emotions you have about the other parent will help you stay focused on creating an unbiased record. State the facts and try to keep the emotions out of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>
<p>Using a spiral notebook, Excel document, or any other form that will help you keep track of every interaction, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Times of calls or visits</li>
<li>Topics discussed (either between you or the other spouse or between the other spouse and your child or children). This does not have to mean an invasion of privacy, but if you&rsquo;re able to get a gauge of what was discussed between your child or children and the other parent it only builds a stronger case</li>
<li>Duration of phone call or visit</li>
<li>Was the interaction spontaneous or part of a pre-arranged visitation schedule?</li>
<li>How the child or children felt prior to the visit or call, as well as after</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionaltips"> <strong>Additional Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent in your record keeping. If that means setting a daily time to record anything that has happened, then do so. Waiting days or weeks to record an interaction will make it difficult for you to remember specifics.</li>
<li>Be neutral! Try to not let emotion get ahold of you.</li>
<li>Research your state laws regarding auto recordings and telephone calls. In some jurisdictions, recording conversations is illegal.</li>
<li>Work with a lawyer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-your-child-testify">Should Your Child Testify?</h2>
<p>get litigious you want to pull out all the stops to make your case. You might be tempted to have your child testify. This can be especially tempting if your child has expressed that they would want to be with you full time. But before you move forward with allowing your child to testify, there are some things you should consider.</p>
<h3 id="considerations-before-hearing">Considerations Before Hearing</h3>
<p>Here are some things you&rsquo;ll want to consider: <strong>Is it necessary for your child to testify?</strong> And what are your reasons behind why you want your child to provide testimony? Will your child be able to provide the judge with information regarding his or his home life and how the current custody arrangement is impacting them? Is your child mature enough to express his or his desires? If your reasoning behind having your child provide testimony is field by revenge or wanting to embarrass your spouse, then you should refrain. But if your reasoning is fueled by fear of the child&rsquo;s life being endangered by living with the othis parent, then you should let them testify. <strong>What are the effects this will have?</strong> Divorce and being shuffled between two homes is already a tough experience for a child to go through. Will testifying make your child feel as if they have to choose sides? How will this make them feel? How will this impact your relationship with them? How would you feel if they were testifying against you? Co-parenting is a large part of this &ldquo;new world&rdquo; your child is in, and you should encourage a healthy co-parenting environment. If your child has expressed in interest in testifying, try to get behind the real reasons. Are they just afraid they will lose time with you? Do they just need some reassurance? What are the testimony laws in your state? A divorce and family law attorney will be able to help you understand the child testimony laws in your state. In California, a child 14 years or older is allowed to testify during divorce proceedings, unless the testimony is not in the &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; of that child. A court will also consider the testimony of a child under the age of 14 if that child is deemed mature enough to be able to provide a competent testimony.</p>
<h3 id="final-advice">Final Advice</h3>
<p>The decision of allowing your son or daughter to provide testimony should not be taken lightly. You should with the pros and cons of the situation, and really listen to your child&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask the tough questions of yourself and of your child to get to the bottom of what they impact this testimony will have. Keeping your child&rsquo;s best interest in mind will help steer your decision to the one that is correct for you and your child.</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody">Joint Custody</h2>
<p>to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that kids respond best to both parents being in their lives. Joint custody is when two parents share decision-making responsibilities and/or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living together, or even if they never lived together.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Custody</strong></h3>
<p>There are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-co-parenting-relationship">Creating a Co-Parenting Relationship</h2>
<p>If you have gone to court for custody, and the court decided to award joint custody, chances are there will be a number of issues you and your ex-spouse will need to work through. If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. If you&rsquo;re newly <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorced</a>, right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be placed in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>There are certain things that any child will need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>

<p>You might be recently engaged or about to be engaged. If you are, you might just be asking &ldquo;is a prenuptial right for me and my partner?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="is-a-prenuptial-for-you">Is a Prenuptial for You?</h2>
<p>Typically prenups are an important consideration for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>older couples (because they typically have acquired assets);</li>
<li>those who come into a marriage with assets;</li>
<li>people who have children from prior relationships;</li>
<li>people who expect future significant income, such as high-net worth individuals</li>
<li>anyone and everyone looking to be married</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High Net-Worth Divorce</strong>High Net-Worth Divorce is a unique divorce scenario that involves parties who, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission are situations <em>“in which a natural person who has individual net worth, or joint worth with the person’s spouse, that exceeds $1 million dollars at the time of purchase, excluding the value of the primary residence of such person; or a natural person with an income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year.”</em>  Such a financial situation carries with it specific differences that require the skill of an experienced high net-worth divorce lawyer. With the expertise of a reputable high net-worth attorney, you can greater protect your assets and finances from the costly divorce process. <strong>Small Percentage of the Population</strong> , 619 Divorce will provide you with the excellent legal counsel you require for maximizing your success in the courtroom.</p>
<h2 id="prenuptial-agreements-for-everyone">Prenuptial Agreements for Everyone</h2>
<p>But prenups aren&rsquo;t just for the super-rich. As Joslin Davis, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, explains, creating a prenuptial agreement — or for unmarried couples, a cohabitation agreement — can make sense for many people. &ldquo;It requires people to think ahead,&rdquo; she said. Young couples can also benefit from the creation of a prenuptial agreement because it provides them a chance to plan out issues like paying off one partner&rsquo;s student-loan debt, or compensation for leaving the workforce to care for their future children.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-mistakes-in-a-prenuptial-agreement">Avoid Mistakes in a Prenuptial Agreement</h3>
<p>If there are mistakes in a prenuptial agreement it can be declared invalid, which can cause much greater headaches should your marriage turn to divorce. Some common mistakes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same Legal Representation – Both spouses need separate attorneys to ensure each understands the prenuptial agreement independently of the other. This ensures the signing of the final prenuptial agreement is voluntary, without one spouse feeling as if they are being pressured into signing it.</li>
<li>Signed Under Duress – If one party feels pressured into signing the prenuptial agreement, or if they were influenced by drugs or alcohol affecting their mental capacity, it can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Signed Too Soon Before the Wedding - Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to sign the prenuptial agreement. If the couple divorces soon after the wedding, an argument that one party was coerced into signing can be argued. The prenuptial agreement should be signed one to three months before the wedding to give the spouse sufficient time to think about and consider what they are signing.</li>
<li>No Full Disclosure – Make sure the prenuptial agreement discloses all assets and debts.</li>
<li>Child Support Provisions – Do not include child custody or support. If the couple divorces and children are involved, the court will rule in whatever is the best interests of the child and not what was in the prenuptial agreement. If child custody and support are included the whole prenuptial agreement can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Biased - If the prenuptial agreement seems biased towards one spouse party, it can be decided it&rsquo;s unenforceable or “unconscionable.”</li>
<li>Unenforceable Provisions – If a prenuptial agreement has unusual provisions, such as who does the dishes or takes out the garbage, they can be deemed unenforceable, which will weaken it.</li>
<li>Oral Agreement – A prenuptial agreement should be in written and multiple copies made. Each spouse and spouse&rsquo;s attorney should have a copy of the prenuptial agreement.</li>
<li>Ambiguous Writing – If anything is unclear, or there is ambiguous wording, the prenuptial agreement can be challenged in court.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-bring-up-a-prenuptial-agreement">How to Bring Up a Prenuptial Agreement</h2>
<p>It can feel really awkward to bring up the subject of a prenuptial agreement. Amid all the excitement of an engagement, it can honestly feel like a downer to broach the topic. Here are some tips: Bring it up sooner rather than later. When the conversation about a prenuptial agreement is brought up early on, it allows a couple to discuss what they want from a marriage. Chances are you and your spouse are already ironing things out when it comes to the future of your marriage. A conversation about a prenuptial allows you to forecast what might happen during that marriage. For example - family businesses, children, economic goals are all aspects that can affect a prenuptial agreement. Hire a mediator that will listen to both sides and craft an agreement that both of you agree to. After the agreement is settled, you&rsquo;ll want to have separate attorneys review the agreement to ensure it will be upheld if ever challenged. Remember that having the conversation about a prenuptial agreement is an opportunity for you to practice open dialogue with each other. Look at it as an opportunity to hone the skills you will need in your marriage.</p>
<h2 id="marital-property-division">Marital Property Division</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to do everything you can to protect yourself financially. Doing so means completely understanding <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhabited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the higher wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. You&rsquo;ll want to work with a divorce attorney in the state in which you are divorcing so they can help advise you on your state&rsquo;s specific laws regarding property division.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>

<p>Large amounts of student debt can ruin your financial picture. But can it also ruin your marriage?</p>
<h2 id="can-student-debt-cause-divorce">Can Student Debt Cause Divorce?</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that college tuition can lead to piles of debt, putting of homeownership, and sacrificing retirement savings, but a new report shows that it also might lead to failed marriages. According to the report, done by Student Loan Hero, 13% of divorced couples say that student loans were what ended their marriage. The statistic makes sense. Money problems are often the root cause of divorce, and for a long time now, student loan debt has been one of the biggest financial issues facing our nation. That financial issue can also spill into your divorce as you work to iron out the intricacies of child support, spousal support, and how to make it on your own with only your income.</p>
<h2 id="finances-after-divorce">Finances After Divorce</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve decided to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">end your marriage</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of your emotional life, and that definitely doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of your financial freedom. There is nothing easy about ending a marriage. You&rsquo;re going to feel out of place for a while. Everything is new. Chances are you&rsquo;ve had to rearrange your schedule to now pick up the kids from their dad&rsquo;s house every other weekend. It might mean you&rsquo;re not spending Christmas with your parents so that the children can spend Hanukkah with their mom&rsquo;s family. You might need to set up an automatic child support and spousal support payment to your ex-husband for every third week of the month. Or maybe you need to call your now ex-wife to make sure that she drops off the soccer cleats at the school that your son left at his house over the weekend. Regardless of what the situation is, things have changed. And that means your financial situation has. But just because everything is different, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should steer your course for financial ruin. Yes, losing a second income is hard. It can be especially hard if you were living off of one income and now have to go back to the land of the full-time worker. These are some tips and tricks that can help ensure that your divorce doesn&rsquo;t translate to financial ruin.</p>
<h2 id="tips-from-the-experts">Tips From the Experts</h2>
<p>Here are some tips from some financial experts; certified divorce financial analyst Eva Sachs, Emily McBurney, an attorney and qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO) expert, and certified divorce financial analyst Donna Cheswick.</p>
<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<p>Sachs says the first step toward financial independence is balancing your income with your expenses. This can be hard to do if you&rsquo;ve never had to in the past. He advises you sit down and look at how much money is coming in from various avenues like work, alimony and/or child support payments, and then assess how much of that is going toward living expenses. &ldquo;Think of it as a spending plan rather than a budget,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Knowing where your money goes is key, especially after divorce. These will be many new expenses you might not have thought about prior to your divorce; this is a critical time to refrain from spending money you don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; <strong>Who Are Your Benefactors?</strong> Most likely your spouse was your main benefactor before your divorce. So one of the first things you need to do, according to McBurney is update the beneficiary on your life insurance and retirement accounts. &ldquo;Review all of your accounts and insurance policies and change the beneficiaries. A divorce does <em>not</em> automatically terminate your former spouse’s rights to be the beneficiary on your retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies –- even though your divorce decree might say that your former spouse has waived all rights to the benefits,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You will need to formally submit a change of beneficiary form to each financial institution. Otherwise, the benefit will be paid to whoever is listed on their forms at the time of your death &ndash; regardless of your divorce.&rdquo; Take this opportunity to reflect on the people in your life that are around to support you and encourage you. This can be a hard step, changing your beneficiary, because you&rsquo;ve never imagined having to remove your spouse. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want to revise your will, says Cheswick. &ldquo;Meet with an estate planning attorney to discuss your state’s laws regarding possible updates to your will, power of attorney and advanced directives,&rdquo; she suggests. &ldquo;You want to be sure that your former spouse is no longer entitled to any distribution in the event of your death. And if your settlement agreement requires one party to maintain life insurance on the other, then there needs to be a method in place to be sure this is actually occurring. Just because the former spouse says they will do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are following through.&rdquo; <strong>Emergency Funds</strong> When you and your spouse were married, you knew you could rely on each other if one of you lost your job, had a medical emergency, or if something in the house needed immediate repair. But now if anything unexpected pops up, you&rsquo;re going to alone. This can be scary. But if you&rsquo;re smart about it, and plan for it, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Sachs recommends, to help protect yourself, create an emergency fund that you continue adding to whenever you have the chance. &ldquo;An emergency fund should equal three to six months of your living expenses,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If you can swing it, I recommend six months because you&rsquo;re now single and need an even bigger cushion if you are not able to work or an emergency occurs.&rdquo; <strong>Really Finalize</strong> Even though the divorce papers are signed an finalized, according to Cheswick, your work isn&rsquo;t really complete until you&rsquo;ve ensured the assets awarded in the settlement have been distributed. This means doing your due diligence and following up with your spouse and all the shared accounts that you used to have. If the information and assets have not been transferred to you, you will need to ensure that they are. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of people who will contact me months (and unfortunately even years) after their divorce is finalized and there are still outstanding items which have not been resolved,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Remember that the agreement is a legally binding contract that you both signed and agreed to uphold. If one party is failing to comply with the terms of the contract then the other party has every right to take steps to ensure their compliance including going back to court to have the agreement enforced.&rdquo; .&quot; <strong>You Still Need to Plan for Retirement</strong> As the divorce gets closer to being finalized, Sachs advises looking to ways of maximizing your retirement savings. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let divorce stop you from planning for your future,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Investing in your 401K plan will allow you to save for retirement. You can begin by saving a small amount each week and then let it build slowly or make payroll contributions that match your employer contributions. Don&rsquo;t stop thinking of the future!&rdquo; Just because you are no longer going to be sharing your golden years with your ex-spouse, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have the time of your life. Getting your financial situation under control is the first step to taking back your life and claiming your bright future.</p>
<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
<p>After your divorce is finalized you&rsquo;ll be able to reclaim your life and do things you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. Follow whatever it is that your heart desires. By doing so you are offering yourself to the world and finding your own unique way that makes you feel alive. You can choose to stay shut in by the pain of loss and old wounds, but remember that the world will continue to turn. Don&rsquo;t you want to be a part of it?</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court.

<p>Looks like the custody battle is still bubbling between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. The two announced their divorce almost two years ago, but it appears they&rsquo;re still struggling to work out a custody agreement.</p>
<h2 id="custody-issues-for-brad-and-angelina">Custody Issues for Brad and Angelina</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Brad and Angelina are not even close to settling their divorce,&rdquo; a source recently said. &ldquo;They are so hung up on dealing with the custody issues that they haven&rsquo;t even exchanged any financial documents yet, which is routine in divorces and one of the first steps people take in the filing process.&rdquo; The two had initially decided on a custody schedule, but that was disrupted when Jolie decided to accept a role for a movie in Europe. She requested to take all six children abroad with her, which disrupted any time Pitt was looking to spend with them. In the end, a judge ruled &ldquo;not having a relationship with their father is harmful&rdquo; for the children and that he finds it is &ldquo;critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother.&rdquo; Pitt was then allowed to have custody of five of the children. Maddox, who is 16 was allowed to choose how he spends his time with either parent, from June 27 to July 1 for ten hours each day. Pitt was ultimately cleared of any allegations against him regarding child abuse. He&rsquo;s hopeful that the two will be able to resolve their custody issues.</p>
<h2 id="when-child-custody-becomes-war">When Child Custody Becomes War</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody</a> cases can get combative. Typically, both parents want equal time with their children. But all too often a parent will try to argue that the other parent isn&rsquo;t fit to raise a child. Here are some things you can do to protect yourself when entering a litigious custody case. It&rsquo;s important to remember that most courts will want to reward joint custody. If that happens in your case, it will be up to you to create a livable co-parenting relationship. When resolving custody cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the other parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the other parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the other parent</li>
<li>If the other parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the other parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions. Being able to remove any emotions you have about the other parent will help you stay focused on creating an unbiased record. State the facts and try to keep the emotions out of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>
<p>Using a spiral notebook, Excel document, or any other form that will help you keep track of every interaction, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Times of calls or visits</li>
<li>Topics discussed (either between you or the other spouse or between the other spouse and your child or children). This does not have to mean an invasion of privacy, but if you&rsquo;re able to get a gauge of what was discussed between your child or children and the other parent it only builds a stronger case</li>
<li>Duration of phone call or visit</li>
<li>Was the interaction spontaneous or part of a pre-arranged visitation schedule?</li>
<li>How the child or children felt prior to the visit or call, as well as after</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionaltips"> <strong>Additional Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent in your record keeping. If that means setting a daily time to record anything that has happened, then do so. Waiting days or weeks to record an interaction will make it difficult for you to remember specifics.</li>
<li>Be neutral! Try to not let emotion get ahold of you.</li>
<li>Research your state laws regarding auto recordings and telephone calls. In some jurisdictions, recording conversations is illegal.</li>
<li>Work with a lawyer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-your-child-testify">Should Your Child Testify?</h2>
<p>get litigious you want to pull out all the stops to make your case. You might be tempted to have your child testify. This can be especially tempting if your child has expressed that they would want to be with you full time. But before you move forward with allowing your child to testify, there are some things you should consider.</p>
<h3 id="considerations-before-hearing">Considerations Before Hearing</h3>
<p>Here are some things you&rsquo;ll want to consider: <strong>Is it necessary for your child to testify?</strong> And what are your reasons behind why you want your child to provide testimony? Will your child be able to provide the judge with information regarding his or his home life and how the current custody arrangement is impacting them? Is your child mature enough to express his or his desires? If your reasoning behind having your child provide testimony is field by revenge or wanting to embarrass your spouse, then you should refrain. But if your reasoning is fueled by fear of the child&rsquo;s life being endangered by living with the othis parent, then you should let them testify. <strong>What are the effects this will have?</strong> Divorce and being shuffled between two homes is already a tough experience for a child to go through. Will testifying make your child feel as if they have to choose sides? How will this make them feel? How will this impact your relationship with them? How would you feel if they were testifying against you? Co-parenting is a large part of this &ldquo;new world&rdquo; your child is in, and you should encourage a healthy co-parenting environment. If your child has expressed in interest in testifying, try to get behind the real reasons. Are they just afraid they will lose time with you? Do they just need some reassurance? What are the testimony laws in your state? A divorce and family law attorney will be able to help you understand the child testimony laws in your state. In California, a child 14 years or older is allowed to testify during divorce proceedings, unless the testimony is not in the &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; of that child. A court will also consider the testimony of a child under the age of 14 if that child is deemed mature enough to be able to provide a competent testimony.</p>
<h3 id="final-advice">Final Advice</h3>
<p>The decision of allowing your son or daughter to provide testimony should not be taken lightly. You should with the pros and cons of the situation, and really listen to your child&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask the tough questions of yourself and of your child to get to the bottom of what they impact this testimony will have. Keeping your child&rsquo;s best interest in mind will help steer your decision to the one that is correct for you and your child.</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody">Joint Custody</h2>
<p>to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that kids respond best to both parents being in their lives. Joint custody is when two parents share decision-making responsibilities and/or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living together, or even if they never lived together.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Custody</strong></h3>
<p>There are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-co-parenting-relationship">Creating a Co-Parenting Relationship</h2>
<p>If you have gone to court for custody, and the court decided to award joint custody, chances are there will be a number of issues you and your ex-spouse will need to work through. If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. If you&rsquo;re newly <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorced</a>, right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be placed in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>There are certain things that any child will need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>

<p>Having issues with your co-parent? There might just be an app to fix that problem!</p>
<h2 id="an-app-to-help-you-co-parent">An App to Help You Co-Parent</h2>
<p>Below is a list of apps that were designed to help with co-parenting situations: <strong>Our Family Wizard</strong> has an all-in-one calendar, in addition to a place to view expenses and parenting agreements. <strong>2 Houses</strong> was built for split houses. This app allows co-parents to share photos, videos, as well as manage expenses and co-parenting schedules so everyone&rsquo;s on the same page. <strong>Coparently</strong> creates a perfect platform for parents that have a hard time communicating. There&rsquo;s an easy-to-use calendar, a way to track shared expenses, and also a place to keep contact information. Kids can be added for their communication ease so they don&rsquo;t feel the need to be the communication link between parents. <strong>Cozi</strong> allows for parents to share calendar pages, and also provides users with separate kids&rsquo; calendars so they can share with their co-parents, too. <strong>Custody Exchange</strong> allows for co-parents to create a shared custody calendar in order to keep track. <strong>Talking Parents</strong> is an online system-of-record for co-parents for couples that need legal proof of communication between parties in an effort to prevent further conflict or misunderstanding that may affect custody agreements or the children.</p>
<h3 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h3>
<p>When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is a totally new and different lifestyle, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. This goes for newly divorced parents, as well as parents that have been divorced and co-parenting for years.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side while scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, there are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are together, try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex-share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teacher conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to each other and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends step-parent, and other family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or other important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements-and-holidays">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements and Holidays</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays and every event that happens during the holidays. This means creating a holiday season schedule. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. There are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Is your marriage on the rocks? Here are a couple of warning signs you&rsquo;ll want to look for. As is always advised, if you are considering divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to work with a family law attorney that can guide you through the divorce process.</p>
<h2 id="signs-your-marriage-is-on-the-rocks">Signs Your Marriage Is On The Rocks</h2>
<p>The following signs could indicate that your marriage needs some help.</p>
<h3 id="youre-not-happy">You&rsquo;re not happy.</h3>
<p>Sure, every relationship has its ups and downs but constantly feeling unhappy is a clear sign that this isn&rsquo;t good anymore.</p>
<h3 id="the-majority-of-your-interactions-are-not-positive">The majority of your interactions are not positive.</h3>
<p>According to marriage researcher John Gottman, happy couples have an interaction ratio of 20:1 — that&rsquo;s 20 positive interactions to 1 negative interaction. Conflicted couples have a ratio of 5:1, and couples nearing divorce are .8:1.</p>
<h3 id="you-create-reasons-to-avoid-your-partner">You create reasons to avoid your partner.</h3>
<p>If you are avoiding your partner or creating reasons to avoid your partner, you should consider talking with a marital therapist. Examples are sitting in the car to avoid going inside your house or wanting to hang out more with friends and family instead of at home.</p>
<h3 id="your-friends-or-family-are-encouraging-you-to-end-the-relationship">Your friends or family are encouraging you to end the relationship.</h3>
<p>Friends and family that are closest to you may be able to see things clearly even when you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="your-instincts-are-telling-youits-over">Your instincts are telling you it&rsquo;s over.</h3>
<p>Is your stomach always in a knot? That might just be your gut instinct telling you it&rsquo;s over. Talking with an expert or therapist who can help you weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<h3 id="you-and-your-spouse-live-like-roommates">You and your spouse live like roommates.</h3>
<p>Does he sleep in one room and you sleep in another room? Are you leading separate lives? Are you okay with it? If so, you&rsquo;ve crossed into roommate zone and you need to decide if you want to continue living that way.</p>
<h3 id="everything-feels-hard">Everything feels hard.</h3>
<p>If every interaction feels like a chore or is painful, like deciding on breakfast or when to go to the grocery story, you&rsquo;ll want to consider if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h3 id="one-or-both-have-changed-values-or-priorities">One or both have changed values or priorities.</h3>
<p>In most good relationships, couples value the same &lsquo;big&rsquo; things. But that can change over time. Often times what one person used to value doesn&rsquo;t&rsquo; matter much over time. Lifestyle changes or job opportunities or even religions can cause people to change. Unless you are both able to adapt, it can be a tough thing to overcome.</p>
<h3 id="sudden-changes-in-behavior">Sudden changes in behavior.</h3>
<p>If one partner suddenly drops lots of weight and takes a renewed interest in their appearance or maybe starts spending a lot of time away from home, you might need to take a closer look into what could be an &lsquo;outside reason&rsquo; for this.</p>
<h2 id="are-these-signs-ringing-a-bell"><strong>Are these signs ringing a bell?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have more than 2-3 of the signs listed above you might want to spend some time to sit down and have an open conversation with your spouse. If that is not possible, you might want to consider speaking with a marital therapist that can advise you on how to have an open conversation with your spouse. If after reading these signs, and you decide that you want a divorce and that there is no way you can work things out with your spouse, you should consider calling a family law attorney.</p>
<h2 id="the-divorce-process">The Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different, and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage.

<p>While it may seem that calling off a divorce is a rarity, it&rsquo;s something that happens quite often. For couples thinking about divorce, who are still unsure, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there are other options to consider.</p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="divorcehttps619divorcecomsan-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer-san-diego-collaborative-law--divorce-mediation-lawyer"><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">Divorce</a></h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge eithis. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children togethis, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce. In fact, there are various forms of divorce available (of course, you will need to ensure your state laws regarding these types of divorce), including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce.  <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involved a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations, and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce. Regardless of if you want a divorce, want a legal separation, need an annulment, or decide to cancel a divorce like the Dempsey&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s always advised that you work with a divorce attorney.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things that need to be settled during a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>: alimony, <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child support and visitation</a>, marital property. But perhaps the most valuable asset, that is often forgotten about, is your spouse&rsquo;s retirement account.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-and-retirement-accounts">Divorce and Retirement Accounts</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that the struggling economy has put a large dent in retirement, and people&rsquo;s ability to save for retirement, the truth is that  retirement funds are a big and booming business. Americans have actually been successful in putting away decent est eggs, which can often amount to thousands of dollars. During your marriage it was assumed that any money put away into a retirement fund would be for the both of you. Thisefore, if you&rsquo;re now facing divorce, you should know you still have a right to some of that retirement fund.</p>
<h3 id="finances-and-divorce">Finances and Divorce</h3>
<p>During a divorce, it is advised that you make a careful inventory of your assets, including joint accounts, property, lines of credit, and debt. What often gets missed? Retirement accounts. The first thing you will need to do is locate and identify both yours and your spouse&rsquo;s retirement accounts. If you&rsquo;re able to speak with your spouse, try asking about these accounts. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a person to have more than one IRA or 401(k). This is especially true if they have had various jobs. If you&rsquo;re not able to ask, or if they withhold that information from you, you or your <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/" title="San Diego Family Law Attorney">family law lawyer</a> may need to contact each employer individually to inquire about their retirement plans. It might be in your best interest to work with a lawyer as some companies might need a court order before they are able to release this type of information.</p>
<h3 id="laws-regarding-retirement-funds">Laws Regarding Retirement Funds</h3>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve received the information regarding the existing retirement accounts, you will need to determine how much you are eligible to receive. Various laws apply to the types of accounts. IRAs are regulated by state laws, while 401k, pensions, etc., fall under federal guidelines. Your family law lawyer or accountant will be able to advise you on those laws and thus should be able to aid you in determining the exact numbers. A typical rule of thumb is that the split will be even but limited to the amount in the accounts that accrued during the time you were married until the time you separated. , or marital property rights for the benefit of a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent. It is a judgment for a retirement plan to pay child support, alimony, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or othis dependent. The QDRO needs to contain specific information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the participant and each alternate payee’s name and last known mailing address, and</li>
<li>the amount or percentage of the participant&rsquo;s benefits to be paid to each alternate payee.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this document is drafted, it will be submitted to a judge for approval. A QDRO is not able to award an amount or form of benefit not available under the plan. The person receiving the QDRO benefits from a retirement plan reports the payments received just as if he or she were a plan participant. A benefit that is paid to a child or othis dependent is taxed to the original participant in the plan. An individual receiving retirement plan monies under a QDRO may be able to roll over tax-free all or part of the distribution. If a person receiving QDRO payments is eithis the employee&rsquo;s spouse or former spouse, then he or she can roll it over, just as if he or she themselves were the employee receiving the plan distribution.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-qdro">Importance of QDRO</h2>
<p>Retirement benefits have special legal requirements, which is why it&rsquo;s important to draft a QDRO and not just rely on your divorce agreement to solve the issue of retirement accounts. In order to maintain the tax benefits that come with retirement funds (and be designated an Alternative Payee), you must go through a QDRO. It&rsquo;s important that you sign and finalize the QDRO before you finalize and sign your divorce agreement. Working through the legalities of retirement funds after the divorce has been finalized can be time-consuming and possibly ineffective.</p>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>You also do not need to take the retirement benefits themselves, but instea,d use them as a dollar figure in your general divorce negotiations. For example, you would have the accounts reviewed and evaluated by a financial professional and then receive othis assets in lieu of that value. So if the retirement accounts are estimated at $500k and the value of the house is $500k, you might decide to keep the house while your spouse gets the retirement account. If you do decide to take the retirement funds, it&rsquo;s advised you roll them over into a new retirement account eithis in a standard market product like a mutual fund, or as a self-directed account. A mutual fund is easier, and the returns will be close to what othiss are seeing. The self-directed route requires a more attention, but allows you to move beyond Wall Street and perhaps invest in a property or business. Regardless of the step you take, do your research.</p>
<h2 id="financial-aspects-of-divorce">Financial Aspects of Divorce</h2>
<p>In addition to working through any retirement plan options you have, thise are some othis financial tips you&rsquo;ll want to take when settling your divorce.  According to chief economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pa., Mark Zandi,  “Divorce generally results in a significant financial setback for all those involved.” Don&rsquo;t let your divorce set you back too far. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Itemize all assets and liabilities - property, lines of credit, debt, valuables like furniture, stock options, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t fight over the house. Often times people overlook how much debt comes with a house in terms of mortgages, monthly and yearly upkeep, and utilities. It might be in both of your best interests to sell the house and split the headaches/profits</li>
<li>Get a handle on your after divorce expenses. You&rsquo;ll now be living off of one income or one spousal support payment, so you&rsquo;ll be completely responsible for handling your own financial situation. This means any unseen costs are going to be coming out of your pocket, and your pocket alone. You&rsquo;ll need to be an expert on your families finances, including: food, clothes and othis essentials.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t seek revenge during the divorce. Going for everything your spouse has will just leave you with bigger legal bills and less money that you can split. Try to remain civil and keep the legal costs down.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget about tax time. Thise are various tax rules regarding alimony and child support payments. Make sure those considerations are taken into account when you are deciding on the division of assets. A financial planner or experience family law attorney will be able to advise you on the best way to not get hit during tax time.</li>
<li>Once the divorce is final, don&rsquo;t forget to remove your spouse from your will, change any health-care proxy or a power of attorney that names your former spouse, and change all your passwords.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>

<p>Co-parenting is difficult, but it can be even harder during the summer season. Divorce can often be the hardest felt among children. But what can parents do to off-set the negative impact of <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> especially during an already super busy summer holiday season? The answer: find ways to create a successful co-parenting relationship.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting-over-the-summer">Co-Parenting Over the Summer</h2>
<p>The summer holiday season is all about shuffling back and forth - from parties to shopping centers, to homes, to friends&rsquo; homes. If this was difficult to accomplish as a married couple, it can be even harder to accomplish as a divorced co-parenting team. During the summer, it&rsquo;s all about the pre-schedule. But before we get to that, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about what &ldquo;co-parenting&rdquo; means.</p>
<h3 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h3>
<p>When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is a totally new and different lifestyle, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. This goes for newly divorced parents, as well as parents that have been divorced and co-parenting for years.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side while scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, there are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are together, try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex-share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teacher conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to each other and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends step-parent, and other family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or other important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements-and-holidays">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements and Holidays</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays and every event that happens during the holidays. This means creating a holiday season schedule. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. There are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>As Hollywood &ldquo;breakovers&rdquo; prove time and time again, you can move on from a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a> and re-discover a stronger and healthier you.</p>
<h2 id="breakover">&ldquo;Breakover&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Khloe Kardashian, Miranda Lambert, and Reese Witherspoon have all gone through the celeb &ldquo;breakover&rdquo; - the makeover that happens following a traumatic divorce. While your happily-ever-after marriage has ended, there are next steps and the things that will help you get back that feeling you call &ldquo;normal.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="self-care-taking-care-of-yourself">Self-Care! Taking care of yourself.</h2>
<p>According to Natalie Greggs, a family law attorney from Allen, Texas, “Self-care is the number one thing that gets you through the day.” Though she is a family law attorney, and not a therapist, she advises clients that self-care is the best method to get them through this rough time.</p>
<h3 id="self-care-is-future-well-being">Self-Care is Future Well-Being</h3>
<p>Self-care is more than just a way to get through each day while you go through your divorce. Self-care is also crucial for the well-being of your future as well. Numerous studies indicate that stress is a cause of long-term health problems. Research also indicates that individuals going through a divorce has a heightened risk for some long-term chronic health problems. This research is even more scarier when faced with the fact that experts mention that 40-50% of all marriages end in divorce.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-sane-during-your-divorce">Keeping Sane During Your Divorce</h3>
<p>Hise are some self-care tips to practice while you go through a divorce: <strong>Exercise.</strong> Gregg advises, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not on a regular exercise routine, get on one. You don&rsquo;t have to belong to a gym. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything fancy. Just take a walk every day.&rdquo; Khloe Kardashian is a great example of this tip from Gregg. Following a traumatic and long divorce from basketball star Lamar Odom, Kardashian threw herself in a tough workout routine with the help of celeb trainer Gunner Peterson. Even if you&rsquo;re not going through a divorce, exercise is good for you. For people going through traumatic times, it is especially helpful. Exercise encourages your body to produce endorphins, a feel-good chemical for the brain. Certified integrative nutrition coach and personal trainer Lindsay Hunt, says exercise also helps increase self-confidence, improves sleep, reduces anxiety symptoms, and reduces stress and depression. Any form involving physical movement is helpful such as walking, dancing, swimming, and yoga. The trick is to find something you really enjoy doing. That way chances are you&rsquo;ll want to keep doing it often and on a regular basis. Anothis tip is to find a friend or &ldquo;workout buddy&rdquo; to help encourage you to get off that couch and get moving. They can also encourage you be holding you accountable for getting up and out. <strong>Change Your Diet Up.</strong> When people are faced with emotional issues it can cause you to lose and/or gain weight. Divorce can increase these ups and down, making them go out of control. You can go from one extreme to anothis, from completely restricting meals to binging on unhealthy foods. &ldquo;I had a slender client who, over the course of a year, proceeded to lose probably 50 pounds,&rdquo; remembers Greggs. &ldquo;By the end of his case, she was skeletal.&rdquo; While some may lose weight, othiss can gain. Mikki Meyer, a licensed marriage and family thisapist, said she had a client who ended up gaining almost 100 pounds. Hunt suggests trying to be proactive and pre-emptive about both diet as well as divorce. Diet has a big part in affecting your mood, which is important during a divorce. Hunt reveals, &ldquo;Eating the right foods may ease depression and calm anxiety.&rdquo; He recommends eating three meals a day consisting of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Having a variety like this helps keep blood sugar levels stable as well as helping to prevent dips leading to cravings. Studies also show that diets high in antioxidants help with depression. So fill that plate high with fruit and veggies. When changing your diet it&rsquo;s best to try avoiding sugar, salty foods, artificial ingredients, excessive caffeine consumption, and especially alcohol. According to studies, dehydration tends to increase stress hormone levels. Because of this, Hunt recommends drinking lots of water.</p>
<h3 id="more-healthy-foods-for-your-brain">More Healthy Foods for Your Brain</h3>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty wild fish such as salmon, and nuts, can help brain function and improves your mood. Steel-cut oatmeal also adds serotonin-boosting complex carbohydrates. It is also a comfort food. If you seem to have trouble eating, you might think about drinking your nutrition. You can make bone broth into a soup that&rsquo;s filled with minerals like magnesium. Your body can easily absorb and helps promotes healthy digestion for upset stomachs. Anothis way to get nutrition if you have trouble eating is protein shakes. Green vegetable juices are also a good source of nutrition. You can also try taking smaller bites of protein and healthy fats such as eggs, nuts, and avocados. This will help you so you don&rsquo;t lose too much weight. According to Hunt, &ldquo;It is important to feed your body even if you are not hungry, as our immune systems become extremely vulnerable and weak during times of sadness and stress. Finding foods that are comforting and easy to get down is important for your health.&rdquo; <strong>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s hard to return to a normal schedule, it&rsquo;s important to try. Greggs says, &ldquo;Consistency is important for your emotional health. Show up to work on time. Have your routine. Make [yourself] and your children go to bed when you usually go to bed. Don’t act like the divorce is ending your life.&rdquo; <strong>Get Sunshine.</strong> Sunlight boosts vitamin D which your body needs for natural processes and for increasing serotonin levels. Hunt advises, &ldquo;Aim for sunlight every day.&rdquo; Studies indicate at least 15 minutes every day is helpful. <strong>Network of Support.</strong> Friendships you had when you were married can be can be difficult to keep after your divorce. According to Meyer, &ldquo;When people split up, they often lose their friendship bases. Their friends usually pick one or the othis; it&rsquo;s too difficult to have [both couple members] in their lives.&rdquo; This &ldquo;division of friends&rdquo; when you have a division caused by divorce can increase depression, anxiety, and can result in social isolation. If your previous social networks and friends aren&rsquo;t part of your life anymore, Meyer suggests finding some new ones. Thise are lots of available options such as support groups, outings by Meetup.com, charity groups you&rsquo;ve wanted to be involved in, and religious groups. Additional good advice is to avoid social networks and groups your ex-spouse might also be involved with. As Meyer says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a knitting class, as long as it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo; <strong>Try to Relax.</strong> Stress is never good for anybody. Stress caused by divorce can lead to a number of physical ailments. Gregg says his clients have had hair loss, crashing immune systems, high blood pressure, gastrointestinal issues, and many othiss. Some ways to eliminate stress or keep it under control is joining a yoga group or get regular massages. He says, &ldquo;It helps them get grounded. They can breathe, calm themselves down and feel their body again.&rdquo; Thise are also a number of free and low-cost option if you can&rsquo;t afford these activities. Joining a community center offers things like low-cost yoga classes and othis programs. You can also ask friends and relatives to give you gift certificates to massage thisapists or othis types of classes for Christmas and birthday presents.  503-3050</p>

<h2 id="alicia-silverstone-after-divorce">Alicia Silverstone After Divorce</h2>
<p><em>American Woman</em> star Alicia Silverstone is back on the dating scene and she loves it. The 41-year-old actress recently told <em>Redbook</em> magazine, “I’m super excited about being available and open to whatever’s next. Of course, there’s tons about it that’s confusing. I call my girlfriends and I’m like, ‘What does this mean?’”</p>
<h3 id="divorced-in-february">Divorced in February</h3>
<p>This past February, Silverstone and estranged husband Chris Jarecki announced they were splitting up after 20 years of marriage. The couple has worked to establish a healthy co-parenting relationship for their  7-year-old son Bear.  “Obviously, it’s heartbreaking.” said the <em>Clueless</em> star. “You don’t ever think you’ll be apart when you get married. All I can really say is that we’ll co-parent Bear together, and this is completely a good thing for both of us.” Silverstone’s <em>American Woman</em> character - Bonnie Nolan - is a mom raising her children while working on her career and struggling with a divorce - a role which closely mirrors Silverstone&rsquo;s current life.</p>
<p>“I’m always bringing all of myself to every single part that I play, because obviously that’s what I love to do,” Silverstone has said. “I read the script and loved the story and thought it was great … I just fell in love with the role, I thought, ‘What an incredible role for an actress to do, to get to be so many different things and to get to be so strong and so vulnerable.’ She goes through so much and she’s just fighting for her life.”</p>

Numerous studies indicate that stress is a cause of long-term health problems. Research also indicates that individuals going through a divorce have a heightened risk for some long-term chronic health problems. This research is even scarier when faced with the fact that experts mention that 40-50% of all marriages end in divorce.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-sane-during-your-divorce">Keeping Sane During Your Divorce</h3>
<p>Here are some self-care tips to practice while you go through a divorce: <strong>Exercise.</strong>  Even if you&rsquo;re not going through a divorce, exercise is good for you. For people going through traumatic times, it is especially helpful. Exercise encourages your body to produce endorphins, a feel-good chemical for the brain. Certified integrative nutrition coach and personal trainer Lindsay Hunt, says exercise also helps increase self-confidence, improves sleep, reduces anxiety symptoms, and reduces stress and depression. Any form involving physical movement is helpful such as walking, dancing, swimming, and yoga. The trick is to find something you really enjoy doing. That way chances are you&rsquo;ll want to keep doing it often and on a regular basis. Another tip is to find a friend or &ldquo;workout buddy&rdquo; to help encourage you to get off that couch and get moving. They can also encourage you be holding you accountable for getting up and out. <strong>Change Your Diet Up.</strong> When people are faced with emotional issues it can cause you to lose and/or gain weight. Divorce can increase these ups and down, making them go out of control. You can go from one extreme to another, from completely restricting meals to binging on unhealthy foods. &ldquo;I had a slender client who, over the course of a year, proceeded to lose probably 50 pounds,&rdquo; remembers Greggs. &ldquo;By the end of his case, she was skeletal.&rdquo; While some may lose weight, others can gain. Mikki Meyer, a licensed marriage and family therapist, said she had a client who ended up gaining almost 100 pounds. Hunt suggests trying to be proactive and preemptive about both diet as well as divorce. Diet has a big part in affecting your mood, which is important during a divorce. Hunt reveals, &ldquo;Eating the right foods may ease depression and calm anxiety.&rdquo; He recommends eating three meals a day consisting of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Having a variety like this helps keep blood sugar levels stable as well as helping to prevent dips leading to cravings. Studies also show that diets high in antioxidants help with depression. So fill that plate high with fruit and veggies. When changing your diet it&rsquo;s best to try avoiding sugar, salty foods, artificial ingredients, excessive caffeine consumption, and especially alcohol. According to studies, dehydration tends to increase stress hormone levels. Because of this, Hunt recommends drinking lots of water.</p>
<h3 id="more-healthy-foods-for-your-brain">More Healthy Foods for Your Brain</h3>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty wild fish such as salmon, and nuts, can help brain function and improves your mood. Steel-cut oatmeal also adds serotonin-boosting complex carbohydrates. It is also a comfort food. If you seem to have trouble eating, you might think about drinking your nutrition. You can make bone broth into a soup that&rsquo;s filled with minerals like magnesium. Your body can easily absorb and helps promotes healthy digestion for upset stomachs. Another way to get nutrition if you have trouble eating is protein shakes. Green vegetable juices are also a good source of nutrition. You can also try taking smaller bites of protein and healthy fats such as eggs, nuts, and avocados. This will help you so you don&rsquo;t lose too much weight. According to Hunt, &ldquo;It is important to feed your body even if you are not hungry, as our immune systems become extremely vulnerable and weak during times of sadness and stress. Finding foods that are comforting and easy to get down is important for your health.&rdquo; <strong>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s hard to return to a normal schedule, it&rsquo;s important to try. Greggs says, &ldquo;Consistency is important for your emotional health. Show up to work on time. Have your routine. Make [yourself] and your children go to bed when you usually go to bed. Don’t act like the divorce is ending your life.&rdquo; <strong>Get Sunshine.</strong> Sunlight boosts vitamin D which your body needs for natural processes and for increasing serotonin levels. Hunt advises, &ldquo;Aim for sunlight every day.&rdquo; Studies indicate at least 15 minutes every day is helpful. <strong>Be Preventative where Your Health is Concerned.</strong> Sociology Professor and director of the Population Research Center Mark Hayward, from the University of Texas—Austin, has researched the long-term health effects and discovered stress from divorce accelerates biological processes that can lead to cardiovascular disease. He has found that divorced, middle-aged women tend to be more likely to develop heart disease compared with non-divorced, middle-aged married women.  503-3050</p>

<p>When it comes to divorce, property, child visitation, and even taxes can be easy in comparison to one thing - the family dog.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-about-the-dog">So What About the Dog?</h2>
<p>Divorce is hard. Decisions must be made about children, property, and finances. While that can seem overwhelming, it&rsquo;s doable. One thing that&rsquo;s hardest: decisions on the family dog. In every state except for Alaska and Illinois, pets are seen as property and can be sold just like the house or couch. But if you talk to any dog-owner, you know that rarely is the family pet ever seen as replaceable. Because of this, it&rsquo;s often suggested that divorcing couples agree on a custodial schedule for the dog ― along with division of assets ― before a divorce goes to court.</p>
<p>In the absence of any divorce agreement, it&rsquo;s up to the judge to decide who, if anyone, gets custody of the dog, so your best bet is to plan what you want to do with Rover.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-preparation">Divorce Preparation</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something people ever think they&rsquo;ll have to do - prepare for their divorce. But for couples that are headed in that direction, the best thing you can do is be prepared for what is to come. If you&rsquo;re convinced that your marriage will be ending in <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">divorce</a>, and that your relationship with your spouse is irretrievably broken, then you should take some steps in preparation.</p>
<h3 id="consult-afamily-law-attorneyhttps619divorcecomfamily-law-attorney">Consult a <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">Family Law Attorney</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that you are completely aware of your legal rights and responsibilities when you start the divorce process. A family law attorney can help advise you on everything related to divorce: the paperwork, child custody arrangements, spousal support, and how property will be divided. You&rsquo;ll want to consult an attorney at every step of the process to make sure that you are protected.</p>
<h3 id="copy-legal-documents">Copy Legal Documents</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts of divorce is the paperwork. You&rsquo;ll want to make sure you have everything, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> tax returns,</li>
<li>bank statements,</li>
<li>investment statements,</li>
<li>retirement account statements,</li>
<li>employee benefits handbooks,</li>
<li>life insurance policies,</li>
<li>mortgage documents,</li>
<li>financial statements,</li>
<li>credit card statements,</li>
<li>wills,</li>
<li>Social Security statements,</li>
<li>automobile titles,</li>
<li>joint accounts like phones and utilities,</li>
<li>any joint business venture information</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to ensure that you have copies of any financial data, whether it be electronic or physical copies. Making sure you have all this information will make the process much quicker.</p>
<h3 id="inventory-household-and-possessions">Inventory Household and Possessions</h3>
<p>Property division is a big aspect of the agreement process of divorce. Major assets include homes, furniture, artwork, jewelry, and appliances. Property is decided according to your state&rsquo;s specific laws. This has the potential to be very litigious during a divorce.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-propertyhttps619divorcecomsan-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer">Separate and Community <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/">Property</a></h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inherited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution, property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highest wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case, you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-current-household-budget-and-expenses">Know Your Current Household Budget and Expenses</h3>
<p>Preparing for divorce is knowing how your household money is currently being handled. Often times this means that only one spouse is fully aware of the couple&rsquo;s financial picture. If you are planning for a divorce, it is pertinent that you understand your household&rsquo;s financial picture, including the amount that goes towards utilities, mortgages, and typical household expenses. Getting a better idea of how much is spent every month currently will also help you prepare for when you are budgeting and managing your household after the divorce.</p>
<h3 id="determine-debts">Determine Debts</h3>
<p>If you and your spouse have racked up a considerable amount of debt during your marriage, you will have to determine what happens to that debt during divorce. If you are able to, it&rsquo;s advised that you pay down as much debt as possible prior to divorcing. Allocation of marital debt among divorcing spouses can be one of the most difficult items to negotiate. You&rsquo;ll also want to have an idea of what your debts were like prior to the marriage - so any debt that would be considered “non-marital debt.” This can include student loans and any other lines of credit that were not transferred over during the marriage. This debt belongs to the spouse who incurred it.</p>
<h3 id="know-what-your-spouse-earns">Know What Your Spouse Earns</h3>
<p>For most couples, this information is available simply by looking at a pay-stub. For couples where one spouse is self-employed or owns a business, or receives any portion of income in cash, it can be hard to determine. If this information is not available to you, try to keep track of money that is flowing in. If you are suspicious of your spouse&rsquo;s spending habits, you&rsquo;ll want to try to get as much information as possible. You can also work with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">family law attorney</a> to figure out how to obtain this information in a legal way.</p>
<h3 id="get-a-job">Get a Job</h3>
<p>There is a chance that you or your spouse are not employed. Sometimes one spouse will remain at home to take care of the family, while the other spouse supports the family. If you have been out of the workforce for a while, you will need to assess your employability. Will you be able to obtain a job easily or will you need further education or training?</p>
<h3 id="know-your-credit-history">Know Your Credit History</h3>
<p>Do you know what your current credit score is? If not, then you need to find out. Divorce can impact this, and you&rsquo;ll want to know what your score is so you can plan accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="start-saving">Start Saving</h3>
<p>Once your divorce is finalized, your financial picture will be completely up to you. That means it will all be on your shoulders. It&rsquo;s important that you be able to support your family. This might mean saving some money now.</p>
<h3 id="put-your-kids-first">Put your Kids First</h3>
<p>Divorce can be very hard on children. If you and your spouse cannot agree to child custody arrangements, you will need to find a way to make it work. A family law attorney can help with this.</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-the-divorce-process">Steps for the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>After nearly nine years of marriage, Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum announced they were separating. While proceedings took place in April, it sounds like the couple has already found &ldquo;a new normal where there is a lot of love,&rdquo; according to Dewan.</p>
<h2 id="jenna-dewan-has-found-a-new-normal-after-divorce">Jenna Dewan Has Found a &ldquo;New Normal&rdquo; After Divorce</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We’re just getting used to it. We&rsquo;re in a very positive energy together, trying to be the best parents to Everly,&rdquo; the <em>World of Dance</em> star said in a recent interview. &ldquo;We support each other.&rdquo; &ldquo;The moves I&rsquo;m making are completely not related to my marriage or separation, interestingly enough. I was always very happy being a wife. Those feelings [Who are you? What do you want to give to the world? What excites you?] started bubbling up for me, naturally…so I really wanted to expand my life, and myself. And that was my journey, no one else&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said. The two share a 4-year-old daughter, Everly, and are successfully <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">co-parenting</a>. &ldquo;I feel a sense of joy and freedom and excitement, truly, about a new chapter in my life. And I have no attachments to how that&rsquo;s going to look, or what that&rsquo;s going to be. I feel really open, and I feel hopeful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">Divorce</a> is not only a difficult time in a person&rsquo;s life, but it can also be emotionally traumatic. The relationship with your spouse and the structure of your lives that you helped establish in what you thought would be a happily-ever-after marriage has ended. What are the next steps and the things that will help you get back that feeling you call &ldquo;normal&rdquo;? Although you may not realize it, there are some things you can do to get back there. According to Natalie Greggs, a family law attorney from Allen, Texas, “Self-care is the number one thing that gets you through the day.” Though she is a family law attorney and not a therapist, she advises clients that self-care is the best method to get them through this rough time.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re planning to get divorced this year, you might want to act quickly - the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be taking effect soon - and it might just impact your divorce.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-will-impact-your-divorce">How the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Will Impact Your Divorce</h2>
<p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will effect divorces that happen after December 31, 2018. Under this new set of laws, a taxpayer that pays alimony payments will no longer be able to deduct the payments from his or her spouse. And the alimony recipient will no longer pay taxes on that income. If you are planning on divorcing this year, you might want to act with some urgency. Why? Some states, such as California, require a six-month waiting period for a divorce to be finalized. So if your divorce process has not been started, you might miss the December 18th, 2018 deadline for the alimony deduction. In California, alimony payments generally last for half the life of the marriage unless the couple has been married for at least 10 years, in which cases, those payments can last for life. When you decide to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">end your marriage</a>, it can feel like the end of your financial freedom. How will you handle child support payments or even manage to get food on the table now that you are down to one source of income? It can feel impossible. But just as divorce does not mean the end of your life, it also does not mean the end of your financial freedom.</p>
<h2 id="the-end-of-amarriage">The End of a Marriage</h2>
<p>There is nothing easy about ending a marriage. You&rsquo;re going to feel out of place for a while. Everything is new. Chances are you&rsquo;ve had to rearrange your schedule to now pick up the kids from their dad&rsquo;s house every other weekend. It might mean you&rsquo;re not spending Christmas with your parents so that the children can spend Hanukkah with their mom&rsquo;s family. You might need to set up an automatic child support and spousal support payment to your ex-husband for every third week of the month. Or maybe you need to call your now ex-wife to make sure that she drops off the soccer cleats at the school that your son left at his house over the weekend. Regardless of what the situation is, things have changed. And that means your financial situation has. But just because everything is different, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should steer your course for financial ruin. Yes, losing a second income is hard. It can be especially hard if you were living off of one income and now have to go back to the land of the full-time worker. These are some tips and tricks that can help ensure that your divorce doesn&rsquo;t translate to financial ruin.</p>
<h2 id="gather-resources">Gather Resources</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go it alone,&rdquo; says Mike Lynch, vice president of strategic markets at Hartford Funds. &ldquo;Build a team today – a qualified team of legal, tax and investment professionals. Maybe it&rsquo;s your current investment professional, or you may seek a new one that understands your situation better.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re going to want to put together a legal team to help you reach a settlement in regards to child custody and property division. But you might also want to consider bringing on a team of financial professionals to advise you on things such as how your taxes will need to be filed (Alimony and child support can have large financial impact), in addition to how to make money work for you now that there is only you to help pay the bills.</p>
<h2 id="specifics-to-keep-in-mind">Specifics To Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>Certified divorce financial analyst Eva Sachs, Emily McBurney, an attorney and qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO) expert, and certified divorce financial analyst Donna Cheswick also have this advice:</p>
<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<p>Sachs says the first step toward financial independence is balancing your income with your expenses. This can be hard to do if you&rsquo;ve never had to in the past. He advises you sit down and look at how much money is coming in from various avenues like work, <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">alimony</a> and/or child support payments, and then assess how much of that is going toward living expenses. &ldquo;Think of it as a spending plan rather than a budget,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Knowing where your money goes is key, especially after divorce. These will be many new expenses you might not have thought about prior to your divorce; this is a critical time to refrain from spending money you don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; <strong>Change Your Benefactors</strong> Most likely your spouse was your main benefactor during the marriage, but that is probably not going to be the case moving forward. To remedy this, one of the first things you need to do is update the beneficiary on your life insurance and retirement accounts. &ldquo;Review all of your accounts and insurance policies and change the beneficiaries. A divorce does <em>not</em> automatically terminate your former spouse’s rights to be the beneficiary on your retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies –- even though your divorce decree might say that your former spouse has waived all rights to the benefits,&rdquo; says McBurney. &ldquo;You will need to formally submit a change of beneficiary form to each financial institution. Otherwise, the benefit will be paid to whoever is listed on their forms at the time of your death &ndash; regardless of your divorce.&rdquo; Take this opportunity to reflect on the people in your life that are around to support you and encourage you. This can be a hard step, changing your beneficiary, because you&rsquo;ve never imagined having to remove your spouse. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want to revise your will, says Cheswick. &ldquo;Meet with an estate planning attorney to discuss your state’s laws regarding possible updates to your will, power of attorney and advanced directives,&rdquo; she suggests. &ldquo;You want to be sure that your former spouse is no longer entitled to any distribution in the event of your death. And if your settlement agreement requires one party to maintain life insurance on the other, then this needs to be a method in place to be sure this is actually occurring. Just because the former spouse says they will do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are following through.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="property-division">Property Division</h3>
<p>Marital property division is governed by state laws, but can still get contentious. You will need to check with a family law attorney to see if you live in an equitable distribution state or a community property state. There are four steps to dividing marital property:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify assets owned by you and the assets owned by your spouse</li>
<li>Categorize all assets as &ldquo;marital&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; property (an attorney can help you determine this)</li>
<li>Assign a value to each asset (you might need an appraiser for this)</li>
<li>Devise a plan for the division of assets that is in accordance with state laws</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consider-selling-shared-property">Consider Selling Shared Property</h3>
<p>Instead of fighting over who will retain ownership of the family property, consider selling it and splitting the proceeds. This is a way for each spouse to &ldquo;break even.&rdquo; When it comes to a secondary home, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much more effective to sell the house and distribute the proceeds to the children,&rdquo; says Ric Edelman, chairman and CEO of Edelman Financial Services. &ldquo;You get into the issue of fights amongst the kids – issues of maintenance, repairs and upkeep.&rdquo;  after their divorce is finalized and there are still outstanding items which have not been resolved,&quot; she said. &ldquo;Remember that the agreement is a legally binding contract that you both signed and agreed to uphold. If one party is failing to comply with the terms of the contract then the other party has every right to take steps to ensure their compliance including going back to court to have the agreement enforced.&rdquo; <strong>Plan for Retirement</strong> As the divorce gets closer to being finalized, Sachs advises looking to ways of maximizing your retirement savings. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let divorce stop you from planning for your future,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Investing in your 401K plan will allow you to save for retirement. You can begin by saving a small amount each week and then let it build slowly or make payroll contributions that match your employer contributions. Don&rsquo;t stop thinking of the future!&rdquo; Just because you are no longer going to be sharing your golden years with your ex-spouse, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have the time of your life. Getting your financial situation under control is the first step to taking back your life and claiming your bright future.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage.

<p>Throughout their 20-year-old marriage, Will Smith and wife Jada have dealt with divorce rumors. The 49-year-old actor recently confronted the rumors in a new song.</p>
<h2 id="will-smith-is-not-getting-divorced">Will Smith is NOT Getting Divorced</h2>
<p>In Will Smith&rsquo;s new song, “To the Clique,” he raps about his personal life and directly addresses divorce rumors. “Stop the divorce rumors and mind your damn business,”<em>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em> actor says in the song. He goes on to prasie his family, calling them “The real-life Incredibles.&quot; As Smith recently wrote on his Facebook page: “Under normal circumstances, I don’t usually respond to foolishness (Because it’s contagious),” the <em>Bright</em> actor wrote on Facebook at the time. “But, so many people have extended me their ‘deepest condolences’ that I figured — ‘What the hell… I can be foolish, too!’ So, in the interest of redundant, repetitious, over &amp; over-again-ness… Jada and I are… NOT GETTING A DIVORCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!” He added: “I promise you all — if I ever decide to divorce my Queen — I SWEAR I’ll tell you myself!”</p>
<h3 id="when-divorce-happens">When Divorce Happens</h3>
<p>Sometimes happily ever after doesn&rsquo;t end so happily. Sometimes it ends in divorce. When that happens, unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t call a fairy godmother, but you can call a <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">divorce attorney</a> to walk you through the process.</p>
<h2 id="to-get-a-lawyer-or-not-to-get-a-lawyer">To Get a Lawyer or Not to Get a Lawyer</h2>
<p>Hiring a divorce attorney, or an attorney that specializes in family law is always advised. You&rsquo;re able to represent yourself if you choose to work without a lawyer, but you will need to educate yourself about the court requirements. For example, this means you will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare the applicable official disclosure forms.</li>
<li>Have the applicable official disclosure forms served by a process server and person that is not you that is over 18 years old.</li>
<li>Put all agreements in writing and properly file them with the court for official signatures.</li>
<li>Follow the rules of evidence and legal procedures that govern how and what you are legally allowed to present for the court&rsquo;s review.</li>
<li>Ensure your court filings are in the correct format and that they are compliant with any specific requirements.</li>
<li>Present evidence that is admissible.</li>
<li>Argue issues that a judge would need to consider.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be overwhelming on top of an already overwhelming experience. In cases whise thise are numerous aspects of a marriage that will need to be decided, such as child custody issues, spousal support, and marital property division, you will need an experienced guide to help you reach a fair settlement. Aligning yourself with the right divorce attorney may be the best thing you can possibly do for yourself during this difficult time. It is essential that you fully understand your rights as an individual and as a parent. Whethis or not you decide to work with an attorney, you should educate yourself about the divorce process. An attorney in your state will be able to provide you on your state&rsquo;s specific rules. Hise is a little overview of what it means and what the process is for getting divorced in the state of California.</p>
<h2 id="grounds-for-divorce">Grounds for Divorce</h2>
<p>To start the divorce process, also known as the dissolution of marriage process, you will need to determine the grounds for divorce, or reasons you are filing for divorce. In California, thise are two grounds for divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irreconcilable differences.</strong> This means you and your spouse are unable to agree and will never be able to agree on basic, fundamental issues involving the marriage or your family.</li>
<li><strong>Incurable insanity.</strong> This is almost never used as it requires medical proof that one spouse was insane when the marriage petition was filed and is still incurably insane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you will need to meet residency requirements to file for divorce: you or your spouse must have lived in California for six months and in the county in which you are seeking your divorce for at least three months before filing the dissolution of marriage petition.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-restraining-orders">Temporary Restraining Orders</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know that thise are temporary <em>restraining orders</em> that automatically go into effect once the divorce process begins. These restraining orders prohibit both spouses from doing certain things, including: taking your minor children out of state without the othis spouse&rsquo;s written permission or a court order, canceling or changing the beneficiaries on insurance policies, and transferring property ownership. You will also be required to notify your spouse before any out-of-the-ordinary spending. Because of this it&rsquo;s often advised to close or freeze your joint accounts so no major purchases can be made. In this case, each spouse is able to open their own personal account for daily expenditures.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-and-annulment">Legal Separation and Annulment</h3>
<p>You might not need to file for divorce. Thise are two othis options: legal separation or <em>annulment</em> (also called a <em>nullity</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal separation</strong>. This is a a legal process, granted in the form of a court order, by which a married couple can remain legally married while not living togethis. Some couples use this as a formal break, during which they have some time to decide if they would like to continue the marriage. Thise are often religious, insurance, tax, or othis reasons for wanting a legal separation instead of a formal dissolution. With a legal separation, you and your spouse will remain married, but the court (or you) can divide your property and issue orders relating to child custody, visitation, child support and spousal support, and, if necessary, a restraining order.</li>
<li><strong>Annulment</strong>. Being granted an annulment makes it as if your marriage never existed. Thise are specific requirements you will need to meet to have your marriage annulled. These include being a minor without the consent of your parents or guardian during the time of the marriage, or if certain types of fraud or deceit were involved. An annulment requires you appear in court.</li>
</ul>
<p>The residency requirements for these are less harsh than standard divorces. Eithis of these can be obtained without having lived in California for six months or the county you are filing in for three months prior to filing, as is required for a standard divorce.</p>
<h3 id="summary-dissolution">Summary Dissolution</h3>
<p>In California, you are able to receive a simplified dissolution of marriage if you meet certain requirements. This is called a _summary dissolutio_n. This process requires less paperwork and you will not have to appear in court. You are eligible for a summary dissolution if you and your spouse have agreed in writing to a division of your assets and debts and if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been married for five years or less.</li>
<li>You have no children from the relationship.</li>
<li>Neithis of you own a home or othis real estate.</li>
<li>The value of all community property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>The value of eithis party&rsquo;s separate property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>Your combined debt does not exceed $4,000, except for auto loans.</li>
<li>Both of you waive spousal support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both spouses agree to these terms, you can be granted a summary dissolution. This process can be as easy as filling out a form and turning it in to your local clerk&rsquo;s office. Still, you might want to have a family law attorney review the forms before you file them.</p>
<h3 id="amount-of-time">Amount of Time</h3>
<p>In California, the mandatory waiting period required is 6 months. No couple, regardless of how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; their divorce is can be divorced faster than 6 months. This is the time it takes for the state to change your status from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to &ldquo;single&rdquo;.  You will be able to get all your paperwork turned in to the court and your divorce judgment approved, but the divorce itself will not be final until at least 6 months after the initial petition. In some cases, those that require a lot of things to be required, a divorce can take years. This is based on how much you decided to disagree and agree on. </p>

<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">Divorce</a> is not only a difficult time in a person&rsquo;s life, but it can also be emotionally traumatic. The relationship with your spouse and the structure of your lives that you helped establish in what you thought would be a happily-ever-after marriage has ended. What are the next steps and the things that will help you get back that feeling you call &ldquo;normal&rdquo;? Although you may not realize it, there are some things you can do to get back there.</p>
<h3 id="self-care-during-divorce-how-to">Self Care During Divorce: How-To</h3>
<p>According to Natalie Greggs, a family law attorney from Allen, Texas, “Self-care is the number one thing that gets you through the day.” Though she is a family law attorney and not a therapist, she advises clients that self-care is the best method to get them through this rough time.</p>
<h3 id="self-care-is-future-well-being">Self-Care is Future Well-Being</h3>
<p>Self-care is more than just a way to get through each day while you go through your divorce. Self-care is also crucial for the well-being of your future as well. Numerous studies indicate that stress is a cause of long-term health problems. Research also indicates that individuals going through a divorce have a heightened risk for some long-term chronic health problems. This research is even scarier when faced with the fact that experts mention that 40-50% of all marriages end in divorce.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-sane-during-your-divorce">Keeping Sane During Your Divorce</h3>
<p>Here are some self-care tips to practice while you go through a divorce: <strong>Exercise.</strong>  Even if you&rsquo;re not going through a divorce, exercise is good for you. For people going through traumatic times, it is especially helpful. Exercise encourages your body to produce endorphins, a feel-good chemical for the brain. Certified integrative nutrition coach and personal trainer Lindsay Hunt, says exercise also helps increase self-confidence, improves sleep, reduces anxiety symptoms, and reduces stress and depression. Any form involving physical movement is helpful such as walking, dancing, swimming, and yoga. The trick is to find something you really enjoy doing. That way chances are you&rsquo;ll want to keep doing it often and on a regular basis. Another tip is to find a friend or &ldquo;workout buddy&rdquo; to help encourage you to get off that couch and get moving. They can also encourage you be holding you accountable for getting up and out. <strong>Change Your Diet Up.</strong> When people are faced with emotional issues it can cause you to lose and/or gain weight. Divorce can increase these ups and down, making them go out of control. You can go from one extreme to another, from completely restricting meals to binging on unhealthy foods. &ldquo;I had a slender client who, over the course of a year, proceeded to lose probably 50 pounds,&rdquo; remembers Greggs. &ldquo;By the end of his case, she was skeletal.&rdquo; While some may lose weight, others can gain. Mikki Meyer, a licensed marriage and family therapist, said she had a client who ended up gaining almost 100 pounds. Hunt suggests trying to be proactive and preemptive about both diet as well as divorce. Diet has a big part in affecting your mood, which is important during a divorce. Hunt reveals, &ldquo;Eating the right foods may ease depression and calm anxiety.&rdquo; He recommends eating three meals a day consisting of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Having a variety like this helps keep blood sugar levels stable as well as helping to prevent dips leading to cravings. Studies also show that diets high in antioxidants help with depression. So fill that plate high with fruit and veggies. When changing your diet it&rsquo;s best to try avoiding sugar, salty foods, artificial ingredients, excessive caffeine consumption, and especially alcohol. According to studies, dehydration tends to increase stress hormone levels. Because of this, Hunt recommends drinking lots of water.</p>
<h3 id="more-healthy-foods-for-your-brain">More Healthy Foods for Your Brain</h3>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty wild fish such as salmon, and nuts, can help brain function and improves your mood. Steel-cut oatmeal also adds serotonin-boosting complex carbohydrates. It is also a comfort food. If you seem to have trouble eating, you might think about drinking your nutrition. You can make bone broth into a soup that&rsquo;s filled with minerals like magnesium. Your body can easily absorb and helps promotes healthy digestion for upset stomachs. Another way to get nutrition if you have trouble eating is protein shakes. Green vegetable juices are also a good source of nutrition. You can also try taking smaller bites of protein and healthy fats such as eggs, nuts, and avocados. This will help you so you don&rsquo;t lose too much weight. According to Hunt, &ldquo;It is important to feed your body even if you are not hungry, as our immune systems become extremely vulnerable and weak during times of sadness and stress. Finding foods that are comforting and easy to get down is important for your health.&rdquo; <strong>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s hard to return to a normal schedule, it&rsquo;s important to try. Greggs says, &ldquo;Consistency is important for your emotional health. Show up to work on time. Have your routine. Make [yourself] and your children go to bed when you usually go to bed. Don’t act like the divorce is ending your life.&rdquo; <strong>Get Sunshine.</strong> Sunlight boosts vitamin D which your body needs for natural processes and for increasing serotonin levels. Hunt advises, &ldquo;Aim for sunlight every day.&rdquo; Studies indicate at least 15 minutes every day is helpful. <strong>Be Preventative where Your Health is Concerned.</strong> Sociology Professor and director of the Population Research Center Mark Hayward, from the University of Texas—Austin, has researched the long-term health effects and discovered stress from divorce accelerates biological processes that can lead to cardiovascular disease. He has found that divorced, middle-aged women tend to be more likely to develop heart disease compared with non-divorced, middle-aged married women.  503-3050</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not something people ever think they&rsquo;ll have to do - prepare for their divorce. But for couples that are headed in that direction, the best thing you can do is be prepared for what is to come. If you&rsquo;re convinced that your marriage will be ending in <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">divorce</a>, and that your relationship with your spouse is irretrievably broken, then you should take some steps in preparation.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-preparation">Divorce Preparation</h2>
<h3 id="consult-an-family-law-attorneyhttps619divorcecomfamily-law-attorney">Consult an <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">Family Law Attorney</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that you are completely aware of your legal rights and responsibilities when you start the divorce process. A family law attorney can help advise you on everything related to divorce: the paperwork, child custody arrangements, spousal support, and how property will be divided. You&rsquo;ll want to consult an attorney at every step of the process to make sure that you are protected.</p>
<h3 id="copy-legal-documents">Copy Legal Documents</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts of divorce is the paperwork. You&rsquo;ll want to make sure you have everything, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> tax returns,</li>
<li>bank statements,</li>
<li>investment statements,</li>
<li>retirement account statements,</li>
<li>employee benefits handbooks,</li>
<li>life insurance policies,</li>
<li>mortgage documents,</li>
<li>financial statements,</li>
<li>credit card statements,</li>
<li>wills,</li>
<li>Social Security statements,</li>
<li>automobile titles,</li>
<li>joint accounts like phones and utilities,</li>
<li>any joint business venture information</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to ensure that you have copies of any financial data, whether it be electronic or physical copies. Making sure you have all this information will make the process much quicker.</p>
<h3 id="inventory-household-and-possessions">Inventory Household and Possessions</h3>
<p>Property division is a big aspect of the agreement process of divorce. Major assets include: homes, furniture, artwork, jewelry, and appliances. Property is decided according to your state&rsquo;s specific laws. This has the potential to be very litigious during a divorce.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-propertyhttps619divorcecomsan-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer">Separate and Community <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/">Property</a></h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inherited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution, property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highest wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case, you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-current-household-budget-and-expenses">Know Your Current Household Budget and Expenses</h3>
<p>Preparing for divorce is knowing how your household money is currently being handled. Often times this means that only one spouse is fully aware of the couple&rsquo;s financial picture. If you are planning for a divorce, it is pertinent that you understand your household&rsquo;s financial picture, including the amount that goes towards utilities, mortgages, and typical household expenses. Getting a better idea of how much is spent every month currently will also help you prepare for when you are budgeting and managing your household after the divorce.</p>
<h3 id="determine-debts">Determine Debts</h3>
<p>If you and your spouse have racked up a considerable amount of debt during your marriage, you will have to determine what happens to that debt during divorce. If you are able to, it&rsquo;s advised that you pay down as much debt as possible prior to divorcing. Allocation of marital debt among divorcing spouses can be one of the most difficult items to negotiate. You&rsquo;ll also want to have an idea of what your debts were like prior to the marriage - so any debt that would be considered “non-marital debt.” This can include student loans and any other lines of credit that were not transferred over during the marriage. This debt belongs to the spouse who incurred it.</p>
<h3 id="know-what-your-spouse-earns">Know What Your Spouse Earns</h3>
<p>For most couples, this information is available simply by looking at a pay-stub. For couples where one spouse is self-employed or owns a business, or receives any portion of income in cash, it can be hard to determine. If this information is not available to you, try to keep track of money that is flowing in. If you are suspicious of your spouse&rsquo;s spending habits, you&rsquo;ll want to try to get as much information as possible. You can also work with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">family law attorney</a> to figure out how to obtain this information in a legal way.</p>
<h3 id="get-a-job">Get a Job</h3>
<p>There is a chance that you or your spouse are not employed. Sometimes one spouse will remain at home to take care of the family, while the other spouse supports the family. If you have been out of the workforce for a while, you will need to assess your employability. Will you be able to obtain a job easily or will you need further education or training?</p>
<h3 id="know-your-credit-history">Know Your Credit History</h3>
<p>Do you know what your current credit score is? If not, then you need to find out. Divorce can impact this, and you&rsquo;ll want to know what your score is so you can plan accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="start-saving">Start Saving</h3>
<p>Once your divorce is finalized, your financial picture will be completely up to you. That means it will all be on your shoulders. It&rsquo;s important that you be able to support your family. This might mean saving some money now.</p>
<h3 id="put-your-kids-first">Put your Kids First</h3>
<p>Divorce can be very hard on children. If you and your spouse cannot agree to child custody arrangements, you will need to find a way to make it work. A family law attorney can help with this.</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-the-divorce-process">Steps for the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>

Will Channing Pay Spousal Support?</title><link>https://619divorce.com/divorce-attorney/high-net-worth-divorce/tatum-divorce-channing-pay-spousal-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 12:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://619divorce.com/divorce-attorney/high-net-worth-divorce/tatum-divorce-channing-pay-spousal-support/</guid><description/><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan likely have a lot of things to iron out in light of their divorce announcement. Namely, co-parenting and spousal support</p>
<h2 id="the-tatum-divorce-will-channing-pay-spousal-support">The Tatum Divorce. Will Channing Pay Spousal Support?</h2>
<p>Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, both 37, announced their separation last month after almost nine years of marriage and welcoming 4-year-old daughter Everly in 2013. “We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together,” they wrote in a joint statement. “Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now…We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly.” <em>Forbes</em> estimated that the actor made $60 million in 2013 for movies like <em>The Vow</em>, <em>21 Jump Street</em>, <em>Magic Mike</em> and <em>G.I. Joe: Retaliation.</em> He then made $29 million in 2015, according to the magazine. And in 2017, he also launched his own vodka line, Born and Bred. Various online estimates place the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-high-net-worth-divorce-lawyer/">actor&rsquo;s net worth</a> in the range of $60 to $80 million. Seeing as he is the higher paid actor, Tatum might stand to lose more in a divorce settlement, including any homes, retirement assets, and bank accounts. It&rsquo;s unclear if the couple signed a prenuptial agreement. Another factor that might weigh in is if the couple signed a post-nuptial agreement. These are often created if a spouse becomes increasingly wealthy after the marriage - which is the case with Channing. Tatum or Dewan were not as well known at the time of their marriage but Tatum has since gone on to make a blockbuster amount of money after the couple was married. Either way, it appears that Tatum will most likely be paying spousal support.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-spousal-support">What is Spousal Support?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the process of getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, looking for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">spousal support</a>, or anticipate paying spousal support, you need to understand some important things. While a family law attorney can provide you with specifics about your situation, here are a few general things to know, including tax laws, awarding of spousal support, and what would happen if spousal support payments are not made. Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intended to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to another.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many other factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In other words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal support payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must prove your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whether you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however, this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determining spousal support, the court usually requires the highest earner, whether they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-financial-situation-changes-affect-spousal-support">How do Financial Situation Changes Affect Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The length of spousal support payments could also depend on whether the spouse who is getting the support has any changes in their financial situation, such as starting a new job or getting a raise. The purpose of spousal support is to make sure the spouse receiving it has financial safeguards. If the spouse receiving support doesn&rsquo;t need it anymore in order to maintain their financial stability, the court may decide that they no longer need the spousal support they are receiving.</p>
<h3 id="spousal-support-and-divorce-decision-tax-strategy">Spousal Support and Divorce Decision Tax Strategy</h3>
<p>There are certain basic tax laws you have to keep in mind during and after your divorce if you&rsquo;re going to be paying or receiving spousal support. The bottom line if receiving spousal support is that you have to declare it as income on your taxes. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re paying it, you get to deduct it on your taxes. Spousal support is different from child support since child support is neither declared nor deducted on your taxes.</p>
<h3 id="taxes-and-divorce-ruling">Taxes and Divorce Ruling</h3>
<p>agreements, you have to remember this rule since it impacts the bottom line of your finances. The decision and ruling reflect your intentions when it&rsquo;s time to do your taxes. For example, you may decide that the spouse who is paying the spousal support should agree to pay the tax liability of the spouse who is receiving the spousal support. You should discuss this with your family law attorney during the hearing for your spousal support determination. If you&rsquo;re still on good terms with your spouse, it would be helpful to discuss and decide on the best tax deal that would work for you both. If you&rsquo;re not on good times, this might be difficult to come to a mutual tax deal decision, but if you can manage come to a mutual agreement it will save both of you lots of time and headaches when it&rsquo;s tax season. If you get spousal support you should prepare for a potential impact when tax time comes. Your ex isn&rsquo;t able to withhold income taxes from your support checks, which means you have to account for the taxes when you file your tax return. Because of this, you may want to consider paying taxes on a quarterly basis, which will save you from being hit with a big tax liability when April 15th comes around. If you&rsquo;re paying spousal support remember you can deduct the payments on your income taxes. However, you can&rsquo;t deduct child support or any property distribution. The IRS frequently scrutinizes spousal support payments for the first three years you make the payments. This is to make sure that you&rsquo;re not disguising the spousal support payments as property distribution or something else related to your divorce. A divorce attorney understands all the ins and outs of tax issues relating to divorce and can help you understand the issues during the spousal support hearings and afterward after you begin to make the payments.</p>
<h3 id="not-keeping-up-with-spousal-support-payments">Not Keeping Up with Spousal Support Payments</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual to fall behind when it comes to spousal support payments. This can be caused by various reasons including, job loss, being unable to get a job, or just negligence. If you&rsquo;re receiving the payments, your whole life can be put in disarray and have a damaging effect on it. Here are some suggestions if your ex-spouse falls behind on spousal support payments or fails to make them.</p>
<h3 id="not-receiving-court-ordered-alimony-payments">Not Receiving Court-Ordered Alimony Payments?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re court-ordered alimony payments aren&rsquo;t being received, attempt to discover the reason. See if your ex lost their job recently. Perhaps they were injured and unable to work. If these are the reasons, try to see if the two of you can work out a plan that will make up the lost payments as well as future payments. An attorney can provide an unbiased opinion when it comes to situations like this, and will also provide any legal proof in case you need to take your unpaying ex to court.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-avoid-not-receiving-alimony-payments">How to Avoid Not Receiving Alimony Payments</h3>
<p>If your ex can make spousal payments, has a job, has no injuries, and just doesn&rsquo;t want to pay the court-ordered alimony payments, then you need the legal help of a divorce attorney. A motion will have to be filed in court requesting that a judge order your spouse to pay the past-due alimony payments. The motion also includes the agreement requiring them to keep current on future alimony payments. You should work with a family law attorney experienced in these matters who can draft a legal motion regarding this. The attorney will also be able to serve in court as your representative.</p>
<h3 id="consequences-of-alimony-non-payment">Consequences of Alimony Non-Payment</h3>
<p>There are a number of punishments and fines the court can order for delinquent spouses. The laws governing deliquent spousal payments include various consequences that are different from one state to anothis, but they generally include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contempt charges for the spouse, including fines and jail time.</li>
<li>Withholding the spouse&rsquo;s income. This requires the deliquent spouse’s employer to withhold the spousal support payment amount their paycheck. Then the money is then sent directly to the spouse who is supposed to receive it.</li>
<li>Writ of Execution, which is when the judge gives a portion of the bank accounts or othis assets of the delinquent spouse to the spouse who is supposed to be receiving alimony.</li>
<li>If the amount of delinquent alimony is substantial, you may be able to request that the court issue a money judgment against the spouse for the whole amount owed, including interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contacting a family law attorney will help you to file legal actions to enforce the payment of alimony and to make sure you receive the spousal support owed to you. Thise are various things to be taken into consideration during divorce and spousal support decision. A skilled and qualified family law attorney can assist you to make sure you receive a fair case.

<p>After being accused of sexual misconduct and losing his job as host of <em>The Today Show,</em> Matt Lauer is now facing divorce from his wife Annete Roque</p>
<h2 id="matt-lauer-facing-divorce-after-losing-job">Matt Lauer Facing Divorce After Losing Job</h2>
<p>According to a source close to dethroned news anchor, the 60-year-old former <em>Today</em> show anchor is having a tough time during his divorce proceedings. Lauer was fired from his host spot of the NBC morning show last November due to &ldquo;inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.&rdquo; Since the allegations came out, Lauer has retreated to a house in the Hamptons and recently put up his 11-bedroom Manhattan apartment for sale. &ldquo;Matt cut himself off from the life he knew in Manhattan and has remained for the most part isolated,&rdquo; the source said. &ldquo;He looks exhausted. Matt is finally coming to terms with the reality that his marriage is over and he is in bad shape. He feels he lost everything important in his life overnight. He is embarrassed and ashamed.&rdquo; The two <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">share three children</a> together &ndash; Jack, 16, Romy, 14, and Thijs, 11. &ldquo;Annette plans to receive a very good settlement in this divorce,&rdquo; the source claims. &ldquo;She wants to make sure she and the children will always be well taken care of.&rdquo; The source went on to say, &ldquo;Matt feels terrible and regrets his behavior but his regret isn&rsquo;t enough right now. It feels like all doors have closed for him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>While it might seem like working with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a> attorney will be overwhelming, it can actually simplify the process for you. Below we outline the following aspects you might encounter during your divorce that will require you to work with a divorce attorney: legal separation, spousal support, and child custody. A divorce attorney is the best way for you to resolve these issues.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-on-divorce">Deciding on Divorce</h2>
<p>If you do decide to go through with divorce following your legal separation, or if you just want to skip the separation and start the divorce process, a divorce attorney will be able to walk you through the process. This process includes some of the following: spousal support, child custody, and property division. Below we discuss these three aspects, and why working with a divorce attorney can help you arrive at a smoother outcome.</p>

<h2 id="child-custody">Child Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision-making responsibilities and/or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living together, or even if they never lived together.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>There are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.

<p>One of the hardest things about divorce and child custody is determining where the kids should live. A trend in co-parenting that&rsquo;s attempting to solve that is &ldquo;bird-nesting.&rdquo; Bird-nesting is when a couple keeps one home for their children and take turns living in it. Each parent also has a second home on the side where they live when not in the house.</p>
<h2 id="bird-nesting-the-new-trend-in-co-parenting">Bird-Nesting: The New Trend in Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>As with anything, there are pros and cons to bird-nesting. Below we discuss some of the considerations you&rsquo;ll want to take before committing to a bird-nesting arrangement. This type of arrangement can be helpful because it allows couples to disentangle themselves from the marriage but allows the kids to remain somewhere stable and familiar. Often times it can be difficult to arrange schedules of two parents, but the children are able to retain some sense of normalcy. Financially, this situation can be both harmful and helpful. For families that are able to afford two or three dwellings, this works well. When the finances do not allow for that, this can be a big hit. It&rsquo;s also quite often advised that families sell the home and split the proceeds - so that the division of assets is fair. With bird-nesting, this often allows families the time to wait for the market to be a selling market, thus maximizing the sale of the house. As always, you&rsquo;ll want to come up with a solution that keeps the kids at the forefront.</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody">Joint Custody</h2>
<p>to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that kids respond best to both parents being in their lives. Joint custody is when two parents share decision-making responsibilities and/or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living together, or even if they never lived together.</p>

<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-co-parenting-relationship">Creating a Co-Parenting Relationship</h2>
<p>If you have gone to court for custody, and the court decided to award joint custody, chances are there will be a number of issues you and your ex-spouse will need to work through. If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. If you&rsquo;re newly <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorced</a>, right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be placed in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>There are certain things that any child will need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h2 id="when-child-custody-becomes-war">When Child Custody Becomes War</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody</a> cases can get combative. Typically, both parents want equal time with their children. But all too often a parent will try to argue that the other parent isn&rsquo;t fit to raise a child. Here are some things you can do to protect yourself when entering a litigious custody case. It&rsquo;s important to remember that most courts will want to reward joint custody. If that happens in your case, it will be up to you to create a livable co-parenting relationship. When resolving custody cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the other parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the other parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the other parent</li>
<li>If the other parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the other parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions. Being able to remove any emotions you have about the other parent will help you stay focused on creating an unbiased record. State the facts and try to keep the emotions out of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>
<p>Using a spiral notebook, Excel document, or any other form that will help you keep track of every interaction, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Times of calls or visits</li>
<li>Topics discussed (either between you or the other spouse or between the other spouse and your child or children). This does not have to mean an invasion of privacy, but if you&rsquo;re able to get a gauge of what was discussed between your child or children and the other parent it only builds a stronger case</li>
<li>Duration of phone call or visit</li>
<li>Was the interaction spontaneous or part of a pre-arranged visitation schedule?</li>
<li>How the child or children felt prior to the visit or call, as well as after</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionaltips"> <strong>Additional Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent in your record keeping. If that means setting a daily time to record anything that has happened, then do so. Waiting days or weeks to record an interaction will make it difficult for you to remember specifics.</li>
<li>Be neutral! Try to not let emotion get ahold of you.</li>
<li>Research your state laws regarding auto recordings and telephone calls. In some jurisdictions, recording conversations is illegal.</li>
<li>Work with a lawyer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-your-child-testify">Should Your Child Testify?</h2>
<p>get litigious you want to pull out all the stops to make your case. You might be tempted to have your child testify. This can be especially tempting if your child has expressed that they would want to be with you full time. But before you move forward with allowing your child to testify, there are some things you should consider.</p>
<h3 id="considerations-before-hearing">Considerations Before Hearing</h3>
<p>Here are some things you&rsquo;ll want to consider: <strong>Is it necessary for your child to testify?</strong> And what are your reasons behind why you want your child to provide testimony? Will your child be able to provide the judge with information regarding his or his home life and how the current custody arrangement is impacting them? Is your child mature enough to express his or his desires? If your reasoning behind having your child provide testimony is field by revenge or wanting to embarrass your spouse, then you should refrain. But if your reasoning is fueled by fear of the child&rsquo;s life being endangered by living with the othis parent, then you should let them testify. <strong>What are the effects this will have?</strong> Divorce and being shuffled between two homes is already a tough experience for a child to go through. Will testifying make your child feel as if they have to choose sides? How will this make them feel? How will this impact your relationship with them? How would you feel if they were testifying against you? Co-parenting is a large part of this &ldquo;new world&rdquo; your child is in, and you should encourage a healthy co-parenting environment. If your child has expressed in interest in testifying, try to get behind the real reasons. Are they just afraid they will lose time with you? Do they just need some reassurance? What are the testimony laws in your state? A divorce and family law attorney will be able to help you understand the child testimony laws in your state. In California, a child 14 years or older is allowed to testify during divorce proceedings, unless the testimony is not in the &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; of that child. A court will also consider the testimony of a child under the age of 14 if that child is deemed mature enough to be able to provide a competent testimony.</p>
<h3 id="final-advice">Final Advice</h3>
<p>The decision of allowing your son or daughter to provide testimony should not be taken lightly. You should with the pros and cons of the situation, and really listen to your child&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask the tough questions of yourself and of your child to get to the bottom of what they impact this testimony will have. Keeping your child&rsquo;s best interest in mind will help steer your decision to the one that is correct for you and your child.</p>

<p>When people decide to divorce, very often it&rsquo;s their children that take the separation the hardest. Co-parenting can help to mitigate long-lasting negative affects.</p>
<h2 id="a-study-on-types-of-marriages-and-divorces">A Study on Types of Marriages and Divorces</h2>
<p>A study by sociologist Dr. Paul Amato and Alan Booth of Penn State University found that the type of marriage and type of divorce you have can influence the type of reaction a child will have to the divorce. Low-impact divorces and low-conflict marriages are those whise parents are able to remain civil and discuss their issues. While it might seem that this type of divorce and marriage might have the least negative impacts on children, that just might not be true. Dr. Amato and Booth studied 2,000 married persons and 700 children and concluded that children that had the highest levels of anxiety and depression eithis had low-conflict parents who divorced or high-conflict parents who remained togethis. Why is this? It seems that the dissolution of a high-conflict marriage can removes children from stressful relationships. They are able to understand that divorce will actually help everyone to resolve issues. Whiseas children from low-conflict marriages can view their parents’ divorce as a personal tragedy. This viewpoint can often impact a child&rsquo;s ability to form quality intimate relationships. &ldquo;From the child’s perspective, thise is no evidence that anything is drastically wrong,&rdquo; says Dr. Booth. &ldquo;It is an unexpected, uncontrollable and unwelcome event whise one parent leaves the home and the othis is overwhelmed with the demands of single parenthood and a lowered standard of living.&rdquo; But what can parents do to off-set the negative impact of divorce? Find ways to create a successful co-parenting relationship.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-co-parent">Learning to Co-Parent</h2>
<p>When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all othis aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is totally new and different from what you might expect, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-is-to-set-boundaries">Step Two is to Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, thise are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, thise are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are togethis try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachis conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each othis and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>After being married for nine years Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan have announced they will be divorcing.</p>
<h2 id="channing-tatum-and-jenna-dewan-are-getting-divorced">Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are Getting Divorced</h2>
<p>After meeting on the set of their 2006 film <em>Step Up,</em> the couple was married in 2009. They decided to announce their divorce via Tatum&rsquo;s Instagram, making the joint statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey world! So…We have something we would like to share.</p>
<p>First off, it feels odd that we have to share this kind of thing with everyone, but it’s a consequence of the lives we’ve chosen to lead, which we also happen to be deeply grateful for. We’re living in an incredible moment in time, but it’s also a time where truth can easily get distorted into “alternative facts” 😉 So we want to share the truth so you know that if you didn’t read it here then it’s most certainly fiction.</p>
<p>We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly. We won’t be commenting beyond this, and we thank you all in advance for respecting our family’s privacy. Sending lots of love to everyone, Chan&amp;Jenna.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tatum and Dewan share one child together. Divorce can turn friends into enemies. A better and less stressful solution might be a <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">collaborative divorce</a>. It can also save couples time and money. According to attorney Joryn Jenkins, &ldquo;By the end of the divorce trial, spouses can become enemies. Litigation makes people be mean to each other. … But people usually don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s another option, and lawyers don&rsquo;t tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-collaborative-divorce">What is a Collaborative Divorce?</h2>
<p>A collaborative divorce includes a team of four people: a lawyer for each spouse, a mental health coach, and a financial professional. They all work together to create a divorce agreement which includes alimony, the division of marital property, and child visitation and support. A collaborative divorce is a face-to-face litigation process where each spouse gives their opinion in order to reach emotional as well as financial and legal solutions. &ldquo;The rewards of collaborative divorce are huge,&rdquo; according to attorney Joryn Jenkins. &ldquo;You learn to work out issues and say things in a better way.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="a-collaborative-divorce-is-shorter-and-costs-less">A Collaborative Divorce is Shorter and Costs Less</h3>
<p>A collaborative divorce may save you both time and money. While a regular divorce that goes to a trial may cost $100,000, the average collaborative divorce is about $32,000. In addition to less money, the average collaborative divorce lasts three to four months to settle compared to a divorce trial that can drag on for years. Because a judge makes the final decision in a trial there, there isn&rsquo;t much control when it comes to the process, timing, or outcome of the case. &ldquo;People are raiding their retirement accounts just to pay for divorces,&rdquo; said collaborative attorney Rackham Karlsson. &ldquo;Going to court can be more expensive, more time intensive and corrosive for children.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="collaborative-divorce-a-good-alternative">Collaborative Divorce a Good Alternative</h3>
<p>If a couple can work through their divorce by doing a collaborative divorce compared to a standard one, they save time and money, as well as lots of headaches.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward-after-divorce">Moving Forward After Divorce</h2>
<p>Divorce can be a painful process, and a painful one to heal from. After your divorce is finalized, it&rsquo;s time to move forward. Here are some tips for self-care after divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Change Your Diet Up</li>
<li>Eat Healthy Foods</li>
<li>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule</li>
<li>Get Sunshine</li>
<li>Network of Support</li>
<li>Try to Relax</li>
<li>Practice Mindfulness</li>
<li>Consider Getting Help Using a Therapist or Mental Health Professional</li>
<li>Hold Off on Having Another Relationship</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="options-instead-of-divorce">Options Instead of Divorce</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re debating if you should get divorced or not, there are additional options for you to consider.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-and-annulment">Legal Separation and Annulment</h3>
<p>You might not need to file for divorce. There are two other options: legal separation or <em>annulment</em> (also called a <em>nullity</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal separation</strong>. This is a legal process, granted in the form of a court order, by which a married couple can remain legally married while not living together. Some couples use this as a formal break, during which they have some time to decide if they would like to continue the marriage. There are often religious, insurance, tax, ootheris reasons for wanting a legal separation instead of a formal dissolution. With a legal separation, you and your spouse will remain married, but the court (or you) can divide your property and issue orders relating to child custody, visitation, child support and spousal support, and, if necessary, a restraining order.</li>
<li><strong>Annulment</strong>. Being granted an annulment makes it as if your marriage never existed. Thise are specific requirements you will need to meet to have your marriage annulled. These include being a minor without the consent of your parents or guardian during the time of the marriage, or if certain types of fraud or deceit were involved. An annulment requires you appear in court.</li>
</ul>
<p>The residency requirements for these are less harsh than standard divorces. Eithis of these can be obtained without having lived in California for six months or the county you are filing in for three months prior to filing, as is required for a standard divorce.</p>
<h3 id="summary-dissolution">Summary Dissolution</h3>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">In California</a> you are able to receive a simplified dissolution of marriage if you meet certain requirements. This is called a _summary dissolutio_n. This process requires less paperwork and you will not have to appear in court. You are eligible for a summary dissolution if you and your spouse have agreed in writing to a division of your assets and debts and if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been married for five years or less.</li>
<li>You have no children from the relationship.</li>
<li>Neithis of you own a home or othis real estate.</li>
<li>The value of all community property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>The value of eithis party&rsquo;s separate property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>Your combined debt does not exceed $4,000, except for auto loans.</li>
<li>Both of you waive spousal support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both spouses agree to these terms, you can be granted a summary dissolution. This process can be as easy as filling out a form and turning it in to your local clerk&rsquo;s office. Still, you might want to have a family law attorney review the forms before you file them.</p>
<h3 id="amount-of-time">Amount of Time</h3>
<p>In California, the mandatory waiting period required is 6 months. No couple, regardless of how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; their divorce is can be divorced faster than 6 months. This is the time it takes for the state to change your status from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to single&quot;.  You will be able to get all your paperwork turned in to the court and your divorce judgment approved, but the divorce itself will not be final until at least 6 months after the initial petition. In some cases, those that require a lot of things to be required, a divorce can take years. This is based on how much you decided to disagree and agree on. </p>
<h3 id="filing-for-divorce">Filing for Divorce</h3>

<li>Put all agreements in writing and properly file them with the court for official signatures.</li>

<li>Ensure your court filings are in the correct format and that they are compliant with any specific requirements.</li>
<li>Present evidence that is admissible.</li>
<li>Argue issues that a judge would need to consider.</li>
</ul>

It is essential that you fully understand your rights as an individual and as a parent. Whethis or not you decide to work with an attorney, you should educate yourself about the divorce process. An attorney in your state will be able to provide you on your state&rsquo;s specific rules. Hise is a little overview of what it means and what the process is for getting divorced in the state of California.</p>
<h2 id="grounds-for-divorce">Grounds for Divorce</h2>
<p>To start the divorce process, also known as the dissolution of marriage process, you will need to determine the grounds for divorce, or reasons you are filing for divorce. In California, thise are two grounds for divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irreconcilable differences.</strong> This means you and your spouse are unable to agree and will never be able to agree on basic, fundamental issues involving the marriage or your family.</li>
<li><strong>Incurable insanity.</strong> This is almost never used as it requires medical proof that one spouse was insane when the marriage petition was filed and is still incurably insane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you will need to meet residency requirements to file for divorce: you or your spouse must have lived in California for six months and in the county in which you are seeking your divorce for at least three months before filing the dissolution of marriage petition.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-restraining-orders">Temporary Restraining Orders</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know that thise are temporary <em>restraining orders</em> that automatically go into effect once the divorce process begins. These restraining orders prohibit both spouses from doing certain things, including: taking your minor children out of state without the othis spouse&rsquo;s written permission or a court order, canceling or changing the beneficiaries on insurance policies, and transferring property ownership. You will also be required to notify your spouse before any out-of-the-ordinary spending. Because of this it&rsquo;s often advised to close or freeze your joint accounts so no major purchases can be made. In this case, each spouse is able to open their own personal account for daily expenditures.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-and-annulment">Legal Separation and Annulment</h3>
<p>You might not need to file for divorce. Thise are two othis options: legal separation or <em>annulment</em> (also called a <em>nullity</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal separation</strong>. This is a a legal process, granted in the form of a court order, by which a married couple can remain legally married while not living togethis. Some couples use this as a formal break, during which they have some time to decide if they would like to continue the marriage. Thise are often religious, insurance, tax, or othis reasons for wanting a legal separation instead of a formal dissolution. With a legal separation you and your spouse will remain married, but the court (or you) can divide your property and issue orders relating to child custody, visitation, child support and spousal support, and, if necessary, a restraining order.</li>
<li><strong>Annulment</strong>. Being granted an annulment makes it as if your marriage never existed. Thise are specific requirements you will need to meet to have your marriage annulled. These include being a minor without the consent of your parents or guardian during the time of the marriage, or if certain types of fraud or deceit were involved. An annulment requires you appear in court.</li>
</ul>
<p>The residency requirements for these are less harsh than standard divorces. Eithis of these can be obtained without having lived in California for six months or the county you are filing in for three months prior to filing, as is required for a standard divorce.</p>
<h3 id="summary-dissolution">Summary Dissolution</h3>
<p>In California you are able to receive a simplified dissolution of marriage if you meet certain requirements. This is called a _summary dissolutio_n. This process requires less paperwork and you will not have to appear in court. You are eligible for a summary dissolution if you and your spouse have agreed in writing to a division of your assets and debts and if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been married for five years or less.</li>
<li>You have no children from the relationship.</li>
<li>Neithis of you own a home or othis real estate.</li>
<li>The value of all community property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>The value of eithis party&rsquo;s separate property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>Your combined debt does not exceed $4,000, except for auto loans.</li>
<li>Both of you waive spousal support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both spouses agree to these terms, you can be granted a summary dissolution. This process can be as easy as filling out a form and turning it in to your local clerk&rsquo;s office. Still, you might want to have a family law attorney review the forms before you file them.</p>
<h3 id="amount-of-time">Amount of Time</h3>
<p>In California, the mandatory waiting period required is 6 months. No couple, regardless of how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; their divorce is can be divorced faster than 6 months. This is the time it takes for the state to change your status from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to single&quot;.  You will be able to get all your paperwork turned in to the court and your divorce judgment approved, but the divorce itself will not be final until at least 6 months after the initial petition. In some cases, those that require a lot of things to be required, a divorce can take years. This is based on how much you decided to disagree and agree on. </p>

<p>On March 15, Vanessa Trump filed for divorce from Donald Trump Jr., ending their 12 years of marriage, The couple released a statement on March 16 saying, &ldquo;We have decided to go our separate ways. We will always have tremendous respect for each other and our families. We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority. We ask for your privacy during this time.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="donald-trump-jr-and-wife-vanessa-are-divorcing">Donald Trump Jr. and Wife Vanessa are Divorcing</h2>
<p>The couple met at a fashion show in 2003 when Donald Trump introduced them. They were wed in 2005. While Vanessa Trump tends to remain out of the public eye, she was thrust into headlines after opening a letter containing a suspicious substance. The New York Police Department ultimately deemed the letter harmless.</p>
<p>While there does not appear to be a specific reason for the split, many are speculating the spotlight thrust onto them by Donald Trump Sr.&rsquo;s presidency was just too much to handle.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>While it might seem like working with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a> attorney will be overwhelming, it can actually simplify the process for you. Below we outline the following aspects you might encounter during your divorce that will require you to work with a divorce attorney: legal separation, spousal support, and child custody. A divorce attorney is the best way for you to resolve these issues.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-on-divorce">Deciding on Divorce</h2>
<p>If you do decide to go through with divorce following your legal separation, or if you just want to skip the separation and start the divorce process, a divorce attorney will be able to walk you through the process. This process includes some of the following: spousal support, child custody, and property division. Below we discuss these three aspects, and why working with a divorce attorney can help you arrive at a smoother outcome.</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h2>
<p>Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intended to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differ from one state to another.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many other factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In other words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must prove your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whether you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however, this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determining spousal support, the court usually requires the higher earnerwhetheris they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h2 id="child-custody">Child Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.

<p>To celebrate his divorce being finalized, Russell Crowe is auctioning some of the items he accumulated during his marriage in an auction for Sotheby&rsquo;s called, &ldquo;The Art of Divorce.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="russell-crowe-auctioning-off-marriage-items">Russell Crowe Auctioning Off Marriage Items</h2>
<p>Crowe and Australian actress Danielle Spencer separated five years ago. The divorce is set to be finalized right around auction time. As part of the auction, Crowe has decided to get rid of 29 luxury watches (one worth $50,000), cars, furniture, instruments, cricket gear, and film memorabilia all collected during the marriage. Some of the most notable items include: A pair of seven-foot tall prop horses from Gladiator at $2,000-$4,000 each. His faded leather jock strap from Cinderella Man at $500-$600. 18th-Century Dueling Pistols at $5,000-$8,000. 1890 Leandro Bisiach Violin Used in Master and Commander (the most expensive piece in the collection) at $110,000-$140,000.   In total there are 227 items that will be available for bidding on April 7. The date is significant for Crowe because it is both Russell’s 54th birthday — and his wedding anniversary. “We’ve been separated over five years now, our divorce should be finalized around the time of the auction. Just as we collaborate on the upbringing of our kids, it’s easy for us to work together on something like this. I think she feels the same way I do in regards to just moving on things that help create space for the future…On the practical side, this collection probably equates to three rooms full of things I’ll no longer have to care for, document, clean, tune, and insure,” Crowe said in regards to the auction.  </p>
<h2 id="financial-freedom-after-divorce">Financial Freedom After Divorce</h2>
<p>When you decide to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">end your marriage</a>, it can feel like the end of your financial freedom. How will you handle child support payments or even manage to get food on the table now that you are down to one source of income? It can feel impossible. But just as divorce does not mean the end of your life, it also does not mean the end of your financial freedom.</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-amarriage">The End of a Marriage</h3>
<p>There is nothing easy about ending a marriage. You&rsquo;re going to feel out of place for a while. Everything is new. Chances are you&rsquo;ve had to rearrange your schedule to now pick up the kids from their dad&rsquo;s house every other weekend. It might mean you&rsquo;re not spending Christmas with your parents so that the children can spend Hanukkah with their mom&rsquo;s family. You might need to set up an automatic child support and spousal support payment to your ex-husband for every third week of the month. Or maybe you need to call your now ex-wife to make sure that she drops off the soccer cleats at the school that your son left at his house over the weekend. Regardless of what the situation is, things have changed. And that means your financial situation has. But just because everything is different, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should steer your course for financial ruin. Yes, losing a second income is hard. It can be especially hard if you were living off of one income and now have to go back to the land of the full-time worker. These are some tips and tricks that can help ensure that your divorce doesn&rsquo;t translate to financial ruin.</p>
<h2 id="gather-resources">Gather Resources</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go it alone,&rdquo; says Mike Lynch, vice president of strategic markets at Hartford Funds. &ldquo;Build a team today – a qualified team of legal, tax and investment professionals. Maybe it&rsquo;s your current investment professional, or you may seek a new one that understands your situation better.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re going to want to put together a legal team to help you reach a settlement in regards to child custody and property division. But you might also want to consider bringing on a team of financial professionals to advise you on things such as how your taxes will need to be filed (Alimony and child support can have large financial impact), in addition to how to make money work for you now that there is only you to help pay the bills.</p>
<h2 id="specifics-to-keep-in-mind">Specifics To Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>Certified divorce financial analyst Eva Sachs, Emily McBurney, an attorney and qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO) expert, and certified divorce financial analyst Donna Cheswick also have this advice:</p>
<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<p>Sachs says the first step toward financial independence is balancing your income with your expenses. This can be hard to do if you&rsquo;ve never had to in the past. He advises you sit down and look at how much money is coming in from various avenues like work, alimony and/or child support payments, and then assess how much of that is going toward living expenses. &ldquo;Think of it as a spending plan rather than a budget,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Knowing where your money goes is key, especially after divorce. There will be many new expenses you might not have thought about prior to your divorce; this is a critical time to refrain from spending money you don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; <strong>Change Your Benefactors</strong> Most likely your spouse was your main benefactor during the marriage, but that is probably not going to be the case moving forward. To remedy this, one of the first things you need to do is update the beneficiary on your life insurance and retirement accounts. &ldquo;Review all of your accounts and insurance policies and change the beneficiaries. A divorce does <em>not</em> automatically terminate your former spouse’s rights to be the beneficiary on your retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies –- even though your divorce decree might say that your former spouse has waived all rights to the benefits,&rdquo; says McBurney. &ldquo;You will need to formally submit a change of beneficiary form to each financial institution. Otherwise, the benefit will be paid to whoever is listed on their forms at the time of your death &ndash; regardless of your divorce.&rdquo; Take this opportunity to reflect on the people in your life that are around to support you and encourage you. This can be a hard step, changing your beneficiary, because you&rsquo;ve never imagined having to remove your spouse. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want to revise your will, says Cheswick. &ldquo;Meet with an estate planning attorney to discuss your state’s laws regarding possible updates to your will, power of attorney and advanced directives,&rdquo; she suggests. &ldquo;You want to be sure that your former spouse is no longer entitled to any distribution in the event of your death. And if your settlement agreement requires one party to maintain life insurance on the other, then there needs to be a method in place to be sure this is actually occurring. Just because the former spouse says they will do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are following through.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="property-division">Property Division</h3>
<p>Marital property division is governed by state laws, but can still get contentious. You will need to check with a family law attorney to see if you live in an equitable distribution state or a community property state. There are four steps to dividing marital property:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify assets owned by you and the assets owned by your spouse</li>
<li>Categorize all assets as &ldquo;marital&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; property (an attorney can help you determine this)</li>
<li>Assign a value to each asset (you might need an appraiser for this)</li>
<li>Devise a plan for the division of assets that is in accordance with state laws</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consider-selling-shared-property">Consider Selling Shared Property</h3>
<p>Instead of fighting over who will retain ownership of the family property, consider selling it and splitting the proceeds. This is a way for each spouse to &ldquo;break even.&rdquo; When it comes to a secondary home, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much more effective to sell the house and distribute the proceeds to the children,&rdquo; says Ric Edelman, chairman and CEO of Edelman Financial Services. &ldquo;You get into the issue of fights amongst the kids – issues of maintenance, repairs, and upkeep.&rdquo;  after their divorce is finalized and there are still outstanding items which have not been resolved,&quot; she said. &ldquo;Remember that the agreement is a legally binding contract that you both signed and agreed to uphold. If one party is failing to comply with the terms of the contract then the other party has every right to take steps to ensure their compliance including going back to court to have the agreement enforced.&rdquo; <strong>Plan for Retirement</strong> As the divorce gets closer to being finalized, Sachs advises looking to ways of maximizing your retirement savings. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let divorce stop you from planning for your future,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Investing in your 401K plan will allow you to save for retirement. You can begin by saving a small amount each week and then let it build slowly or make payroll contributions that match your employer contributions. Don&rsquo;t stop thinking of the future!&rdquo; Just because you are no longer going to be sharing your golden years with your ex-spouse, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have the time of your life. Getting your financial situation under control is the first step to taking back your life and claiming your bright future.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<h3 id="is-serving-divorce-papers-using-facebook-legal">Is Serving Divorce Papers Using Facebook Legal?</h3>
<p>While serving divorce papers using Facebook may not sound legal, considering that they can be served using publication if the spouse can&rsquo;t be located, it makes sense. Also, many spouses go into hiding or flee rather than accept divorce papers. In situations such as this, it&rsquo;s frequently common to publicly declare the divorce.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-of-serving-divorce-papers">Difficulty of Serving Divorce Papers</h3>
<p>The purpose of divorce papers being served on your spouse is to let them know a petition for divorce was filed. The paperwork also tells them what terms you are seeking in the divorce, such as child support and custody, spousal support, and other things relating to the marriage. The papers also give them the detailed information they need about how they need to respond to the divorce summons. It can be difficult sometimes to serving divorce papers. After the initial divorce summons or petition is filed with the court, they have to be served on your spouse, or soon-to-be ex. Serving the papers can be done in various ways. When serving these papers it&rsquo;s important that the serving is verified. Without this verification, the divorce cannot proceed in a family law court. If you have a divorce attorney, they most likely will handle serving the divorce papers for you. This process is a critical part of the divorce and an attorney has the means of serving the papers. If you don&rsquo;t have a divorce attorney, you have to read about the various options you have of serving the divorce papers yourself.</p>
<h3 id="serving-divorce-papers---let-me-count-the-ways">Serving Divorce Papers - Let Me Count the Ways!</h3>
<p>Here are some ways of serving divorce papers: <strong>Acceptance of Service:</strong> Any person over 18 can deliver the divorce papers to your spouse. After your spouse has received the papers, they have to date and sign the &ldquo;Acceptance of Service&rdquo; paper and give it back to the person delivering the papers. This is the verification confirming that they&rsquo;ve received the divorce paperwork. <strong>First Class Mail, with acknowledgement:</strong> If the divorce petition is sent by mail, you must add the form that your spouse must sign, date, and return to you by a specific date, as specified in the divorce papers. <strong>Certified mail, return receipt requested:</strong> With this there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;return receipt&rdquo; verification form postcard attached to the envelope containing the divorce petition which they must sign and date. Then the &ldquo;return receipt&rdquo; verification form post card is mailed back to you to confirm that they received the paperwork. This confirms they have been served with the divorce papers. <strong>Personal Service by Sheriff or process server:</strong> Legally you can also hire a sheriff or professional process server who can then deliver the divorce petition to your spouse. The sheriff or process server will then fill out the proof of service form that will then be filed with the court. <strong>By Publication:</strong> If you can&rsquo;t locate your spouse you can do a divorce by publication. The court will issue an Order of Publication that allows the summons to be published. It must be published in a local paper once a week for four consecutive weeks with at least 5 days between each publication. It appears that Facebook may now be a way to serve a divorce summons on a missing spouse by publishing the notification there.</p>
<h3 id="proof-your-spouse-is-missing-or-hiding">Proof Your Spouse is Missing or Hiding</h3>
<p>In order to get approval for a divorce by publication, you have to convince a judge that you can&rsquo;t find your spouse, the Defendant. A divorce by publication occurs &ldquo;only after a judge has been convinced, based on a sworn declaration, of the serving party&rsquo;s inability to find the Defendant after trying hard. Service by publication is commonly used in a divorce action to serve a spouse who has disappeared without a leaving a forwarding address &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="diligent-hunt-for-the-missing-spouse">Diligent Hunt for the Missing Spouse</h3>
<p>In order to divorce by publication, you must prove you performed a diligent and thorough search by following the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>you searched phone book and directory assistance in the area your spouse lives or was known to live;</li>
<li>you have contacted friends and relatives to find the location of your missing spouse;</li>
<li>you asked the post office about forwarding address information for your spouse;</li>
<li>you checked tax collection and property assessor records to see if your missing spouse has property;</li>
<li>you contacted the California Department of Motor Vehicles to find any auto registration for address changes;</li>
<li>you contacted prior employers and landlords of your spouse;</li>
<li>you checked voter registration information;</li>
<li>you employed private investigators to locate your missing spouse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Application for Publication of Summons; Memorandum of Points and Authorities; Declaration of Petitioner in Support Thereof; and Order of Publication. After everything is approved by the court, an Order of Publication will be issued to you. Out of all the options for serving divorces papers, having a divorce attorney do it is your best way. A divorce attorney can also give you advice as to your need to file using publication. Even though Facebook may help when it comes to ending a marriage, many times Facebook can be the reason the relationship ended in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="is-facebook-a-real-reason-to-end-a-relationship">Is Facebook a Real Reason to End a Relationship?</h3>
<p>A Boston University study on &ldquo;face-booking&rdquo; (logging onto Facebook then searching through your colleagues, friends, etc.) may cause some people to decide on divorce. Facebook may seem innocent enough, just logging in, checking on friends, maybe updating your status, and logging out, for just a few minutes. The Boston University study, called &ldquo;Computers in Human Behavior,&rdquo; concluded there is a direct relationship between Facebook and reduced satisfaction in marriage, and also higher rates of divorce. The BU study&rsquo;s author concluded, &ldquo;Although it may seem surprising that a Facebook profile, a relatively small factor compared to other drivers of human behavior, could have a significant statistical relationship with divorce rates and marital satisfaction, it nonetheless seems to be the case. This relationship holds up at both the individual and state levels.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-blame-facebook-for-divorce">Reasons to Blame Facebook for Divorce</h3>
<p>The study theorizes the reason is basically because of the time spent on Facebook instead of with a spouse and spending time checking out what other people are doing. Another reason could also be the relationship is already in trouble, so a spouse may turn to Facebook and other social networking sites as a distraction, or maybe even as a way of looking for another mate, for the future after they get their divorce. Divorce can be both difficult and emotional, and it can become more difficult if you&rsquo;re not able to find your soon-to-be ex-spouse. A divorce attorney is invaluable to help with the various aspects of a divorce, including child and spousal support, child visitation, and the division of marital property. They can also draft the necessary papers for your divorce and help you navigate the various ins and outs of a court system to get the papers served and your divorce finalized. A divorce attorney can also advise you on the steps needed to finalize your divorce so you can begin your new single life. Then you can change your Facebook status to &ldquo;single&rdquo;!

<p>A deadbeat dad, owing $560,000 in child support, was recently arrested after a very odd encounter - he tried to sue a restaurant with claims that he had broken a tooth on a maraschino cherry pit.</p>
<h2 id="deadbeat-dad-brought-down-by-cherry-pit">Deadbeat Dad Brought Down by Cherry Pit</h2>
<p>Joseph Stroup, a man dubbed &ldquo;America’s Most Deadbeat Dad,&rdquo; was recently arrested after being on the run for almost 20 years. In 1989 Stroup was ordered to pay $100 a month in child support for his four children. After claiming that he was unemployed and medically disabled, the amount was lowered to $14 a month after he said he was unemployed and medically disabled. But in 1996 a U.S. court discovered Stroup was, in fact, heading up a successful online business which he sold for more than $2 million. Stroup had stopped paying child support in June 1996 and as a result, two years later, a warrant was issued for his arrest. But Stroup has recently been brought to justice - as the result of a cherry pit. Stroup had been living in Canada, under the name Joop Cousteau. He often frequented a small restaurant. Scott Winograd, former general manager of the restaurant Stroup liked to visit described how &ldquo;One day out of the blue, [Stroup] ordered a Cherry Coke, and he wanted eight maraschino cherries in it, which is just bizarre. That just doesn&rsquo;t happen. &ldquo;About a minute later, he calls the server over and he&rsquo;s clutching his jaw and says, &lsquo;I bit into a pit and broke some dental work,&rsquo; and he holds this pit up.” The staff at the restaurant became instantly suspicious - maraschino cherries generally do not have pits. The next day, according to Winograd, Stroup brought in forms that he claimed were from his dental office. The forms “looked sketchy because it was all handwritten forms… It didn&rsquo;t look official by any means,” said Winograd. It was at that point that Winograd decided it would be smart to Google Stroup. Following that online search, Winograd found an incriminating Facebook page from one of his sons, to whom he owed child support. Eventually, Winograd stumbled upon the Office of the Inspector General&rsquo;s list of deadbeat dads - with Stroup&rsquo;s name listed at the top.   Winograd alerted the authorities and Stroup was detained by the Canadian Border Services Agency and transported to the U.S. on February 15. He is in custody in Detroit, awaiting trial for child support violations.</p>
<h2 id="child-support">Child Support</h2>
<p>, and you receive a petition for child support, you respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-a-child-support-petition">Receiving a Child Support Petition</h2>
<p>Once you receive a child support petition, you must follow the instructions on that petition. This often means you will need to appear in court on a specific date. During the court hearing, a judge will examine your income, the other parent&rsquo;s income, how much time the child spends with each parent, as well as any special circumstances regarding day care or medical expenses, and then determine how much you will pay in child support.</p>
<h2 id="child-support-hearing">Child Support Hearing</h2>
<p>To prepare for the child support hearing, you need to put together and bring the following to court: evidence of your income and any other court requested documents. If you do not believe you are the father of the child, and you have not been legally stated as the father, you are able to request a paternity test. If this request is accepted, the child will need to submit to the test before you are required to make child support payments.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-appear-or-pay">Failure to Appear or Pay</h3>
<p>If you do not appear at the child support hearing or do not make child support payments as ordered by the court, then the court can take measures to collect the unpaid payments. This might mean garnishing your wages, suspension of your driver&rsquo;s license, or over legal actions, such as jail time and fines.</p>
<h2 id="tomlinson-and-jungwirth-co-parenting">Tomlinson and Jungwirth Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>In February Tomlinson purchased a home in Calabasas for Jungwirth and his son. He appears to be renting a $49,000 a month home in the Hollywood Hills to be close to his son so that he can be a more available to co-parent. Though it seems that Tomlinson and Jungwirth are on good terms, co-parenting can be very difficult - especially if you are not fond of the person you are expected to co-parent with. This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Here are some steps you can follow: <strong>Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</strong> In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse. <strong>Step Two is to Set Boundaries</strong> The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Here are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Ashton Kutcher divorced from Demi Moore in 2013. He recently discussed the unique way he moved on from that divorce.</p>
<h2 id="ashton-kutcher-discusses-divorce-from-demi">Ashton Kutcher Discusses Divorce from Demi</h2>
<p>“Right after I got divorced, I went to the mountains for a week by myself,” Kutcher, 40, said during a recent interview. “I did no food, no drink — just water and tea. I took all my computers away, my phone, my everything. I was there by myself, so there was no talking. I just had a notepad, a pen and water and tea — for a week.” The actor also practiced Tai Chi as part of his cleanse. He also took the time to heal from every other relationship he&rsquo;s been in. During the time he wrote letters to every person he&rsquo;d ever been in a relationship with. “I wrote down every single relationship that I had where I felt like there was some grudge or some anything, regret, anything. And I wrote letters to every single person, and on day seven, I typed them all out and then sent them,” he said. The actor compared the process to an Alcoholics Anonymous exercise. Kutcher went on to say his post-divorce trip was “really spiritual and kind of awesome.&quot; Kutcher married actress Mila Kunis in July 2015. The two have two children together.  </p>
<h2 id="self-care-during-divorce">Self Care During Divorce</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">Divorce</a> is not only a difficult time in a person&rsquo;s life, but it can also be emotionally traumatic. The relationship with your spouse and the structure of your lives that you helped establish in what you thought would be a happily-ever-after marriage has ended. What are the next steps and the things that will help you get back that feeling you call &ldquo;normal&rdquo;? Although you may not realize it, there are some things you can do to get back there.</p>
<h3 id="self-care-during-divorce-how-to">Self Care During Divorce: How-To</h3>
<p>According to Natalie Greggs, a family law attorney from Allen, Texas, “Self-care is the number one thing that gets you through the day.” Though she is a family law attorney and not a therapist, she advises clients that self-care is the best method to get them through this rough time.</p>
<h3 id="self-care-is-future-well-being">Self-Care is Future Well-Being</h3>
<p>Self-care is more than just a way to get through each day while you go through your divorce. Self-care is also crucial for the well-being of your future as well. Numerous studies indicate that stress is a cause of long-term health problems. Research also indicates that individuals going through a divorce have a heightened risk for some long-term chronic health problems. This research is even scarier when faced with the fact that experts mention that 40-50% of all marriages end in divorce.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-sane-during-your-divorce">Keeping Sane During Your Divorce</h3>
<p>Here are some self-care tips to practice while you go through a divorce: <strong>Exercise.</strong>  Even if you&rsquo;re not going through a divorce, exercise is good for you. For people going through traumatic times, it is especially helpful. Exercise encourages your body to produce endorphins, a feel-good chemical for the brain. Certified integrative nutrition coach and personal trainer Lindsay Hunt, says exercise also helps increase self-confidence, improves sleep, reduces anxiety symptoms, and reduces stress and depression. Any form involving physical movement is helpful such as walking, dancing, swimming, and yoga. The trick is to find something you really enjoy doing. That way chances are you&rsquo;ll want to keep doing it often and on a regular basis. Another tip is to find a friend or &ldquo;workout buddy&rdquo; to help encourage you to get off that couch and get moving. They can also encourage you be holding you accountable for getting up and out. <strong>Change Your Diet Up.</strong> When people are faced with emotional issues it can cause you to lose and/or gain weight. Divorce can increase these ups and down, making them go out of control. You can go from one extreme to another, from completely restricting meals to binging on unhealthy foods. &ldquo;I had a slender client who, over the course of a year, proceeded to lose probably 50 pounds,&rdquo; remembers Greggs. &ldquo;By the end of his case, she was skeletal.&rdquo; While some may lose weight, others can gain. Mikki Meyer, a licensed marriage and family therapist, said she had a client who ended up gaining almost 100 pounds. Hunt suggests trying to be proactive and preemptive about both diet as well as divorce. Diet has a big part in affecting your mood, which is important during a divorce. Hunt reveals, &ldquo;Eating the right foods may ease depression and calm anxiety.&rdquo; He recommends eating three meals a day consisting of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Having a variety like this helps keep blood sugar levels stable as well as helping to prevent dips leading to cravings. Studies also show that diets high in antioxidants help with depression. So fill that plate high with fruit and veggies. When changing your diet it&rsquo;s best to try avoiding sugar, salty foods, artificial ingredients, excessive caffeine consumption, and especially alcohol. According to studies, dehydration tends to increase stress hormone levels. Because of this, Hunt recommends drinking lots of water.</p>
<h3 id="more-healthy-foods-for-your-brain">More Healthy Foods for Your Brain</h3>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty wild fish such as salmon, and nuts, can help brain function and improves your mood. Steel-cut oatmeal also adds serotonin-boosting complex carbohydrates. It is also a comfort food. If you seem to have trouble eating, you might think about drinking your nutrition. You can make bone broth into a soup that&rsquo;s filled with minerals like magnesium. Your body can easily absorb and helps promotes healthy digestion for upset stomachs. Another way to get nutrition if you have trouble eating is protein shakes. Green vegetable juices are also a good source of nutrition. You can also try taking smaller bites of protein and healthy fats such as eggs, nuts, and avocados. This will help you so you don&rsquo;t lose too much weight. According to Hunt, &ldquo;It is important to feed your body even if you are not hungry, as our immune systems become extremely vulnerable and weak during times of sadness and stress. Finding foods that are comforting and easy to get down is important for your health.&rdquo; <strong>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s hard to return to a normal schedule, it&rsquo;s important to try. Greggs says, &ldquo;Consistency is important for your emotional health. Show up to work on time. Have your routine. Make [yourself] and your children go to bed when you usually go to bed. Don’t act like the divorce is ending your life.&rdquo; <strong>Get Sunshine.</strong> Sunlight boosts vitamin D which your body needs for natural processes and for increasing serotonin levels. Hunt advises, &ldquo;Aim for sunlight every day.&rdquo; Studies indicate at least 15 minutes every day is helpful. <strong>Be Preventative where Your Health is Concerned.</strong> Sociology Professor and director of the Population Research Center Mark Hayward, from the University of Texas—Austin, has researched the long-term health effects and discovered stress from divorce accelerates biological processes that can lead to cardiovascular disease. He has found that divorced, middle-aged women tend to be more likely to develop heart disease compared with non-divorced, middle-aged married women.  503-3050</p>

<p>There are numerous websites that now offer online divorce services. And while it might feel tempting to work with one of these companies, if your divorce is looking as though it might be difficult, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to work with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/">divorce attorney</a>.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>While it might seem like like working with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a> attorney will be overwhelming, it can actually simplify the process for you. Below we outline the following aspects you might encounter during your divorce that will require you to work with a divorce attorney: legal separation, spousal support, and child custody. A divorce attorney is the best way for you to resolve these issues.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>Thise are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-on-divorce">Deciding on Divorce</h2>
<p>If you do decide to go through with divorce following your legal separation, or if you just want to skip the separation and start the divorce process, a divorce attorney will be able to walk you through the process. This process includes some of the following: spousal support, child custody, and property division. Below we discuss these three aspects, and why working with a divorce attorney can help you arrive at a smoothis outcome.</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h2>
<p>Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intenced to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to anothis.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In othis words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must proved your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whethis you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determinig spousal support, the court usually requires the highis earner, whethis they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h2 id="child-custody">Child Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.

<p>For the last 75 years, alimony has been tax deductible for the payer, and the recipient has paid income tax on it. A new tax code that will take place under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will change that.</p>
<h2 id="new-tax-law-changes-alimony">New Tax Law Changes Alimony</h2>
<p>Starting Dec. 31, 2018, alimony will no longer be deductible for the payer, and taxes don&rsquo;t need to be paid on it by the recipient. Family law attorneys predict the new tax laws might make divorces even messier. Being able to offer tax relief to alimony payers has often helped move negotiations along in the divorce process. This new law changes that.  Additionally, the change is likely to mean less money for the recipient, due to the fact that the payer has less money from which they are able to pay, now that the amount is not tax deductible. It&rsquo;s expected that many couples considering divorce might now rush that process so that it can be completed in 2018 before the tax law takes place.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-spousal-support">What is Spousal Support?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the process of getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, looking for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">spousal support</a>, or anticipate paying spousal support, you need to understand some important things. While a family law attorney can provide you with specifics about your situation, here are a few general things to know, including tax laws, awarding of spousal support, and what would happen if spousal support payments are not made. Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intended to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to another.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many other factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In other words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal support payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must prove your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whether you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however, this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determining spousal support, the court usually requires the highest earner, whether they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-financial-situation-changes-affect-spousal-support">How do Financial Situation Changes Affect Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The length of spousal support payments could also depend on whether the spouse who is getting the support has any changes in their financial situation, such as starting a new job or getting a raise. The purpose of spousal support is to make sure the spouse receiving it has financial safeguards. If the spouse receiving support doesn&rsquo;t need it anymore in order to maintain their financial stability, the court may decide that they no longer need the spousal support they are receiving.</p>
<h3 id="spousal-support-and-divorce-decision-tax-strategy">Spousal Support and Divorce Decision Tax Strategy</h3>
<p>There are certain basic tax laws you have to keep in mind during and after your divorce if you&rsquo;re going to be paying or receiving spousal support. The bottom line if receiving spousal support is that you have to declare it as income on your taxes. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re paying it, you get to deduct it on your taxes. Spousal support is different from child support since child support is neither declared nor deducted on your taxes.</p>
<h3 id="taxes-and-divorce-ruling">Taxes and Divorce Ruling</h3>
<p>agreements, you have to remember this rule since it impacts the bottom line of your finances. The decision and ruling reflect your intentions when it&rsquo;s time to do your taxes. For example, you may decide that the spouse who is paying the spousal support should agree to pay the tax liability of the spouse who is receiving the spousal support. You should discuss this with your family law attorney during the hearing for your spousal support determination. If you&rsquo;re still on good terms with your spouse, it would be helpful to discuss and decide on the best tax deal that would work for you both. If you&rsquo;re not on good times, this might be difficult to come to a mutual tax deal decision, but if you can manage come to a mutual agreement it will save both of you lots of time and headaches when it&rsquo;s tax season. If you get spousal support you should prepare for a potential impact when tax time comes. Your ex isn&rsquo;t able to withhold income taxes from your support checks, which means you have to account for the taxes when you file your tax return. Because of this, you may want to consider paying taxes on a quarterly basis, which will save you from being hit with a big tax liability when April 15th comes around. If you&rsquo;re paying spousal support remember you can deduct the payments on your income taxes. However, you can&rsquo;t deduct child support or any property distribution. The IRS frequently scrutinizes spousal support payments for the first three years you make the payments. This is to make sure that you&rsquo;re not disguising the spousal support payments as property distribution or something else related to your divorce. A divorce attorney understands all the ins and outs of tax issues relating to divorce and can help you understand the issues during the spousal support hearings and afterward after you begin to make the payments.</p>
<h3 id="not-keeping-up-with-spousal-support-payments">Not Keeping Up with Spousal Support Payments</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual to fall behind when it comes to spousal support payments. This can be caused by various reasons including, job loss, being unable to get a job, or just negligence. If you&rsquo;re receiving the payments, your whole life can be put in disarray and have a damaging effect on it. Here are some suggestions if your ex-spouse falls behind on spousal support payments or fails to make them.</p>
<h3 id="not-receiving-court-ordered-alimony-payments">Not Receiving Court-Ordered Alimony Payments?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re court-ordered alimony payments aren&rsquo;t being received, attempt to discover the reason. See if your ex lost their job recently. Perhaps they were injured and unable to work. If these are the reasons, try to see if the two of you can work out a plan that will make up the lost payments as well as future payments. An attorney can provide an unbiased opinion when it comes to situations like this, and will also provide any legal proof in case you need to take your unpaying ex to court.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-avoid-not-receiving-alimony-payments">How to Avoid Not Receiving Alimony Payments</h3>
<p>If your ex can make spousal payments, has a job, has no injuries, and just doesn&rsquo;t want to pay the court-ordered alimony payments, then you need the legal help of a divorce attorney. A motion will have to be filed in court requesting that a judge order your spouse to pay the past-due alimony payments. The motion also includes the agreement requiring them to keep current on future alimony payments. You should work with a family law attorney experienced in these matters who can draft a legal motion regarding this. The attorney will also be able to serve in court as your representative.</p>
<h3 id="consequences-of-alimony-non-payment">Consequences of Alimony Non-Payment</h3>
<p>There are a number of punishments and fines the court can order for delinquent spouses. The laws governing deliquent spousal payments include various consequences that are different from one state to anothis, but they generally include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contempt charges for the spouse, including fines and jail time.</li>
<li>Withholding the spouse&rsquo;s income. This requires the deliquent spouse’s employer to withhold the spousal support payment amount their paycheck. Then the money is then sent directly to the spouse who is supposed to receive it.</li>
<li>Writ of Execution, which is when the judge gives a portion of the bank accounts or othis assets of the delinquent spouse to the spouse who is supposed to be receiving alimony.</li>
<li>If the amount of delinquent alimony is substantial, you may be able to request that the court issue a money judgment against the spouse for the whole amount owed, including interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contacting a family law attorney will help you to file legal actions to enforce the payment of alimony and to make sure you receive the spousal support owed to you.

<p>It was no secret that rapper Jay-Z and singer Beyonce&rsquo;s marriage was on the rocks when her album &ldquo;Lemonade,&rdquo; which speaks openly about her husband&rsquo;s infidelity, debuted. Recently Jay-Z opened up about why he and his wife decided not to get divorced.</p>
<h2 id="jay-z-talks-about-infidelity-and-not-getting-divorced">Jay-Z Talks About Infidelity and Not Getting Divorced</h2>
<p>During a recent interview, Jay-Z, 47, explained why he and Beyonce, 36, decided to stay together after his infidelity. &ldquo;For us, we chose to fight for our love. For our family. To give our kids a different outcome. To break that cycle for black men and women. To see a different outcome,&rdquo; Jay-Z said. &ldquo;You know, most people walk away, and the divorce rate is like 50 percent or something ’cause most people can’t see themselves,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone’s face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself.&rdquo; On the rapper&rsquo;s recently released album, 4:44, he talks about not only his infidelity but also his reconciliation with Beyonce. Beyonce famously spoke about her husband&rsquo;s cheating ways on her own album, &ldquo;Lemonade,&rdquo; which initially started the speculation around the two&rsquo;s marriage. &ldquo;We were using our art almost like a therapy session,&rdquo; Jay-Z said. &ldquo;And, you know, at the end of the day we really have a healthy respect for one another&rsquo;s craft,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo; The two were married on April 4, 2008, during a secret wedding in front of friends and family. They have two young daughters and a son.</p>
<h3 id="signs-your-marriage-is-on-the-rocks">Signs Your Marriage Is On The Rocks</h3>
<p>The following signs could indicate that your marriage needs some help.</p>
<h3 id="youre-not-happy">You&rsquo;re not happy.</h3>
<p>Sure, every relationship has its ups and downs but constantly feeling unhappy is a clear sign that this isn&rsquo;t good anymore.</p>
<h3 id="the-majority-of-your-interactions-are-not-positive">The majority of your interactions are not positive.</h3>
<p>According to marriage researcher John Gottman, happy couples have an interaction ratio of 20:1 — that&rsquo;s 20 positive interactions to 1 negative interaction. Conflicted couples have a ratio of 5:1, and couples nearing divorce are .8:1.</p>
<h3 id="you-create-reasons-to-avoid-your-partner">You create reasons to avoid your partner.</h3>
<p>If you are avoiding your partner or creating reasons to avoid your partner, you should consider talking with a marital therapist. Examples are sitting in the car to avoid going inside your house or wanting to hang out more with friends and family instead of at home.</p>
<h3 id="your-friends-or-family-are-encouraging-you-to-end-the-relationship">Your friends or family are encouraging you to end the relationship.</h3>
<p>Friends and family that are closest to you may be able to see things clearly even when you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="your-instincts-are-telling-youits-over">Your instincts are telling you it&rsquo;s over.</h3>
<p>Is your stomach always in a knot? That might just be your gut instinct telling you it&rsquo;s over. Talking with an expert or therapist who can help you weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<h3 id="you-and-your-spouse-live-like-roommates">You and your spouse live like roommates.</h3>
<p>Does he sleep in one room and you sleep in another room? Are you leading separate lives? Are you okay with it? If so, you&rsquo;ve crossed into roommate zone and you need to decide if you want to continue living that way.</p>
<h3 id="everything-feels-hard">Everything feels hard.</h3>
<p>If every interaction feels like a chore or is painful, like deciding on breakfast or when to go to the grocery story, you&rsquo;ll want to consider if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h3 id="one-or-both-have-changed-values-or-priorities">One or both have changed values or priorities.</h3>
<p>In most good relationships, couples value the same &lsquo;big&rsquo; things. But that can change over time. Often times what one person used to value doesn&rsquo;t&rsquo; matter much over time. Lifestyle changes or job opportunities or even religions can cause people to change. Unless you are both able to adapt, it can be a tough thing to overcome.</p>
<h3 id="sudden-changes-in-behavior">Sudden changes in behavior.</h3>
<p>If one partner suddenly drops lots of weight and takes a renewed interest in their appearance or maybe starts spending a lot of time away from home, you might need to take a closer look into what could be an &lsquo;outside reason&rsquo; for this.</p>
<h2 id="are-these-signs-ringing-a-bell"><strong>Are these signs ringing a bell?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have more than 2-3 of the signs listed above you might want to spend some time to sit down and have an open conversation with your spouse. If that is not possible, you might want to consider speaking with a marital therapist that can advise you on how to have an open conversation with your spouse. If after reading these signs, and you decide that you want a divorce and that there is no way you can work things out with your spouse, you should consider calling a family law attorney.</p>
<h2 id="the-divorce-process">The Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different, and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court.

<ul>
<li>Contempt charges for the spouse, including fines and jail time.</li>
<li>Withholding the spouse&rsquo;s income. This requires the deliquent spouse’s employer to withhold the spousal support payment amount their paycheck. Then the money is then sent directly to the spouse who is supposed to receive it.</li>
<li>Writ of Execution, which is when the judge gives a portion of the bank accounts or othis assets of the delinquent spouse to the spouse who is supposed to be receiving alimony.</li>
<li>If the amount of delinquent alimony is substantial, you may be able to request that the court issue a money judgment against the spouse for the whole amount owed, including interest.</li>

<p>A year after announcing their divorce, Anna Faris and Chris Pratt are still committed to putting their son first.  announced their decision to divorce, they also noted that they would continue to put the well-being of their son Jack first.</p>
<h2 id="faris-and-pratt-committed-to-co-parenting">Faris and Pratt Committed to Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>Recently Anna Faris, 41, spoke about her and her ex, Chris Pratt&rsquo;s commitment to their son, 5-year-old Jack. The two split at the end of 2017. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s surrounded by so much love,&rdquo; Faris shared during a recent interview. &ldquo;We constantly reinforce what a great kid he is.&rdquo; Faris went on to say they &ldquo;try to discipline when he&rsquo;s being a little bit naughty but I think the key is surrounding him with a lot of joy and happiness, which he has a ton of.&rdquo; She continued, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s those small moments in life, when your kid says something funny or like for me, I love what I do so I get a kick out of feeling like I nailed a joke well. And family and friends!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="create-a-co-parent-relationship">Create a Co-Parent Relationship</h3>
<p>Creating a relationship with your co-parent can be difficult. You may decide working with a mediator is the best option to making an agreement. Once you establish ground rules for yourself and how to maintain the relationship, over time it becomes easier. Creating a flexible schedule may help get to these &ldquo;easier&rdquo; moments. Even though these may be easier moments, there will be times when things feel impossible. Finding balance with your co-parent may help you both become better people and better parents to your children. By being cooperative with your co-parent, you establish a pattern of life for your children which can carry into the future. The number one priority you and your co-parent need to do is to make sure you put the best interests of your child first.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hie are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side while scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-grandparent-visitation-considerations">What About Grandparent Visitation Considerations?</h2>
<p>.</p>
<h3 id="mediation-before-court">Mediation Before Court</h3>
<p>The official California Courts website advises that grandparents should consider <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">mediation</a> before they pursue going to court for those grandparent visitation rights. “There are a number of problems with pursuing a grandparent visitation claim in family court,” said Gerald Maggio, a divorce mediator located in Orange County. “To start, the courts have huge backlogs. And once a case does get to the front of the line, the family is often ordered to see a mediator anyway.”</p>
<h3 id="how-mediation-can-help-with-grandparent-visitation-rights">How Mediation Can Help with Grandparent Visitation Rights</h3>
<p>The California Courts website suggests that the best way to reach an agreement regarding grandparent visitation rights is through mediation. This is due to the fact that it better serves the child as well as the family through reducing conflicts, time, and money spent on court proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="no-clear-procedure-for-getting-grandparent-visitation-rights">No Clear Procedure for Getting Grandparent Visitation Rights</h3>
<p>Additionally, there really is no clear-cut procedure for grandparents to file an official claim. The claim might need to either be filed under an already existing case or filed as an entirely new case. In fact, there is no official form to file for grandparent visitation rights. “Some grandparents think that they have to file an official claim because their child’s ex-spouse is too unreasonable for mediation,” said Maggio. “But those are often the families that can benefit the most from mediation. Litigation just exacerbates conflict and bad feelings while costing everyone a lot of money.” Grandparent visitation rights are often covered by the parenting plan that is put together during the divorce mediation process. But if the family has decided to go through court, rather than through mediation, often do not include grandparent visitation rights in their co-parenting plan. For families that have pursued court procedures, Maggio noted that these families might want to turn to a divorce or child custody mediator in order to create a specific agreement that includes the grandparent-child relationship.

<p>Gwyneth Paltrow, the celeb that made &ldquo;conscious coupling&rdquo; a hot topic, has recently announced that she will be moving forward and getting married for the second time.</p>
<h2 id="gwyneth-paltrow-moves-forward---into-2nd-marriage">Gwyneth Paltrow Moves Forward - Into 2nd Marriage</h2>
<p>When Gwyneth Paltrow, 46, announced she would be consciously uncoupling from Coldplay singer Chris Martin, she singlehandedly changed our perception of celebrity divorce. The actress recently opened up to speak about her new relationship and her upcoming nuptials with fiance Brad Falchuk. “Personally, at midlife, I have tried to accept how complex romantic love can be,” Paltrow said regarding getting married for a second time. “I have decided to give it a go again, not only because I believe I have found the man I was meant to be with, but because I have accepted the soul-stretching, pattern-breaking opportunities that (terrifyingly) are made possible by intimacy.” She went on to say her past relationships have certainly informed her new ones. “I’m actually the only one in my life who got divorced. This used to feel like a failure; it took me a while to reframe that divorce isn’t a failure,” she admitted. Paltrow explained that before Falchuk, “I had two typical types of relationships.” “One where I was constantly chasing and trying to win someone over, and one where I was put off by the person’s capacity for the relationship — and those relationships were very short-lived,” she says. Now, “For the first time, I feel like I’m in an adult relationship that is sometimes very uncomfortable — because he sort of demands a certain level of intimacy and communication that I haven’t been held to before,” Paltrow says of her fiancé.</p>
<h2 id="self-care-during-divorce-how-to">Self Care During Divorce: How-To</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">Divorce</a> is not only a difficult time in a person&rsquo;s life, but it can also be emotionally traumatic. The relationship with your spouse and the structure of your lives that you helped establish in what you thought would be a happily-ever-after marriage has ended. What are the next steps and the things that will help you get back that feeling you call &ldquo;normal&rdquo;? Although you may not realize it, there are some things you can do to get back there. According to Natalie Greggs, a family law attorney from Allen, Texas, “Self-care is the number one thing that gets you through the day.” Though she is a family law attorney and not a therapist, she advises clients that self-care is the best method to get them through this rough time.</p>
<h3 id="self-care-is-future-well-being">Self-Care is Future Well-Being</h3>
<p>Self-care is more than just a way to get through each day while you go through your divorce. Self-care is also crucial for the well-being of your future as well. Numerous studies indicate that stress is a cause of long-term health problems. Research also indicates that individuals going through a divorce have a heightened risk for some long-term chronic health problems. This research is even scarier when faced with the fact that experts mention that 40-50% of all marriages end in divorce.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-sane-during-your-divorce">Keeping Sane During Your Divorce</h3>
<p>Here are some self-care tips to practice while you go through a divorce: <strong>Exercise.</strong>  Even if you&rsquo;re not going through a divorce, exercise is good for you. For people going through traumatic times, it is especially helpful. Exercise encourages your body to produce endorphins, a feel-good chemical for the brain. Certified integrative nutrition coach and personal trainer Lindsay Hunt, says exercise also helps increase self-confidence, improves sleep, reduces anxiety symptoms, and reduces stress and depression. Any form involving physical movement is helpful such as walking, dancing, swimming, and yoga. The trick is to find something you really enjoy doing. That way chances are you&rsquo;ll want to keep doing it often and on a regular basis. Another tip is to find a friend or &ldquo;workout buddy&rdquo; to help encourage you to get off that couch and get moving. They can also encourage you be holding you accountable for getting up and out. <strong>Change Your Diet Up.</strong> When people are faced with emotional issues it can cause you to lose and/or gain weight. Divorce can increase these ups and down, making them go out of control. You can go from one extreme to another, from completely restricting meals to binging on unhealthy foods. &ldquo;I had a slender client who, over the course of a year, proceeded to lose probably 50 pounds,&rdquo; remembers Greggs. &ldquo;By the end of his case, she was skeletal.&rdquo; While some may lose weight, others can gain. Mikki Meyer, a licensed marriage and family therapist, said she had a client who ended up gaining almost 100 pounds. Hunt suggests trying to be proactive and preemptive about both diet as well as divorce. Diet has a big part in affecting your mood, which is important during a divorce. Hunt reveals, &ldquo;Eating the right foods may ease depression and calm anxiety.&rdquo; He recommends eating three meals a day consisting of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Having a variety like this helps keep blood sugar levels stable as well as helping to prevent dips leading to cravings. Studies also show that diets high in antioxidants help with depression. So fill that plate high with fruit and veggies. When changing your diet it&rsquo;s best to try avoiding sugar, salty foods, artificial ingredients, excessive caffeine consumption, and especially alcohol. According to studies, dehydration tends to increase stress hormone levels. Because of this, Hunt recommends drinking lots of water.</p>
<h3 id="more-healthy-foods-for-your-brain">More Healthy Foods for Your Brain</h3>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty wild fish such as salmon, and nuts, can help brain function and improves your mood. Steel-cut oatmeal also adds serotonin-boosting complex carbohydrates. It is also a comfort food. If you seem to have trouble eating, you might think about drinking your nutrition. You can make bone broth into a soup that&rsquo;s filled with minerals like magnesium. Your body can easily absorb and helps promotes healthy digestion for upset stomachs. Another way to get nutrition if you have trouble eating is protein shakes. Green vegetable juices are also a good source of nutrition. You can also try taking smaller bites of protein and healthy fats such as eggs, nuts, and avocados. This will help you so you don&rsquo;t lose too much weight. According to Hunt, &ldquo;It is important to feed your body even if you are not hungry, as our immune systems become extremely vulnerable and weak during times of sadness and stress. Finding foods that are comforting and easy to get down is important for your health.&rdquo; <strong>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s hard to return to a normal schedule, it&rsquo;s important to try. Greggs says, &ldquo;Consistency is important for your emotional health. Show up to work on time. Have your routine. Make [yourself] and your children go to bed when you usually go to bed. Don’t act like the divorce is ending your life.&rdquo; <strong>Get Sunshine.</strong> Sunlight boosts vitamin D which your body needs for natural processes and for increasing serotonin levels. Hunt advises, &ldquo;Aim for sunlight every day.&rdquo; Studies indicate at least 15 minutes every day is helpful. <strong>Be Preventative where Your Health is Concerned.</strong> Sociology Professor and director of the Population Research Center Mark Hayward, from the University of Texas—Austin, has researched the long-term health effects and discovered stress from divorce accelerates biological processes that can lead to cardiovascular disease. He has found that divorced, middle-aged women tend to be more likely to develop heart disease compared with non-divorced, middle-aged married women.  503-3050</p>

<p>Real Housewives of New York and mogul of the Skinny Girl Brand, Bethenny Frankel is suing her ex for full custody of their 7-year-old.</p>
<h2 id="real-housewives-star-sues-for-full-custody">Real Housewives Star Sues for Full Custody</h2>
<p>Frankel, 47, has reopened her divorce case against ex-husband Jason Hoppy and is seeking full custody of their 7-year-old daughter, Bryn. The exes finally finalized their divorce in July 2016 after six years of marriage and after first announcing their divorce in 2013. Last January the legal battle escalated when Hoppy was arrested for allegedly stalking and harassing Frankel. As a result, the <em>Real Housewives of New York City</em> star was granted a restraining order against him. The settlement of that harassment case included a six-month restraining order that declares Hoppy cannot contact Frankel in any capacity and must stay away from her home and places of employment. Hoppy also cannot go to their daughter’s school when Frankel is present. Should he be found in violation of the order, he will be arrested and could face criminal charges. If he abides by the order the case will be dismissed and sealed. Despite the restraining order, Frankel is still looking to gain full custody of the two&rsquo;s daughter. They are due in court in January.</p>
<h2 id="when-child-custody-becomes-war">When Child Custody Becomes War</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody</a> cases can get combative. Typically, both parents want equal time with their children. But all too often a parent will try to argue that the other parent isn&rsquo;t fit to raise a child. Here are some things you can do to protect yourself when entering a litigious custody case. It&rsquo;s important to remember that most courts will want to reward joint custody. If that happens in your case, it will be up to you to create a livable co-parenting relationship. When resolving custody cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the other parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the other parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the other parent</li>
<li>If the other parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the other parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions. Being able to remove any emotions you have about the other parent will help you stay focused on creating an unbiased record. State the facts and try to keep the emotions out of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>
<p>Using a spiral notebook, Excel document, or any other form that will help you keep track of every interaction, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Times of calls or visits</li>
<li>Topics discussed (either between you or the other spouse or between the other spouse and your child or children). This does not have to mean an invasion of privacy, but if you&rsquo;re able to get a gauge of what was discussed between your child or children and the other parent it only builds a stronger case</li>
<li>Duration of phone call or visit</li>
<li>Was the interaction spontaneous or part of a pre-arranged visitation schedule?</li>
<li>How the child or children felt prior to the visit or call, as well as after</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionaltips"> <strong>Additional Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent in your record keeping. If that means setting a daily time to record anything that has happened, then do so. Waiting days or weeks to record an interaction will make it difficult for you to remember specifics.</li>
<li>Be neutral! Try to not let emotion get ahold of you.</li>
<li>Research your state laws regarding auto recordings and telephone calls. In some jurisdictions, recording conversations is illegal.</li>
<li>Work with a lawyer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-your-child-testify">Should Your Child Testify?</h2>
<p>get litigious you want to pull out all the stops to make your case. You might be tempted to have your child testify. This can be especially tempting if your child has expressed that they would want to be with you full time. But before you move forward with allowing your child to testify, there are some things you should consider.</p>
<h3 id="considerations-before-hearing">Considerations Before Hearing</h3>
<p>Here are some things you&rsquo;ll want to consider: <strong>Is it necessary for your child to testify?</strong> And what are your reasons behind why you want your child to provide testimony? Will your child be able to provide the judge with information regarding his or his home life and how the current custody arrangement is impacting them? Is your child mature enough to express his or his desires? If your reasoning behind having your child provide testimony is field by revenge or wanting to embarrass your spouse, then you should refrain. But if your reasoning is fueled by fear of the child&rsquo;s life being endangered by living with the othis parent, then you should let them testify. <strong>What are the effects this will have?</strong> Divorce and being shuffled between two homes is already a tough experience for a child to go through. Will testifying make your child feel as if they have to choose sides? How will this make them feel? How will this impact your relationship with them? How would you feel if they were testifying against you? Co-parenting is a large part of this &ldquo;new world&rdquo; your child is in, and you should encourage a healthy co-parenting environment. If your child has expressed in interest in testifying, try to get behind the real reasons. Are they just afraid they will lose time with you? Do they just need some reassurance? What are the testimony laws in your state? A divorce and family law attorney will be able to help you understand the child testimony laws in your state. In California, a child 14 years or older is allowed to testify during divorce proceedings, unless the testimony is not in the &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; of that child. A court will also consider the testimony of a child under the age of 14 if that child is deemed mature enough to be able to provide a competent testimony.</p>
<h3 id="final-advice">Final Advice</h3>
<p>The decision of allowing your son or daughter to provide testimony should not be taken lightly. You should with the pros and cons of the situation, and really listen to your child&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask the tough questions of yourself and of your child to get to the bottom of what they impact this testimony will have. Keeping your child&rsquo;s best interest in mind will help steer your decision to the one that is correct for you and your child.</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody">Joint Custody</h2>
<p>to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that kids respond best to both parents being in their lives. Joint custody is when two parents share decision-making responsibilities and/or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living together, or even if they never lived together.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Custody</strong></h3>
<p>There are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-co-parenting-relationship">Creating a Co-Parenting Relationship</h2>
<p>If you have gone to court for custody, and the court decided to award joint custody, chances are there will be a number of issues you and your ex-spouse will need to work through. If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. If you&rsquo;re newly <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorced</a>, right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be placed in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying.

<p>Co-parenting, or rather sharing equal parenting responsibilities after divorce, has become a big trend over the past few years. And now it seems it might become law. Legislatures in more than 20 states are considering bills that would make shared parenting a legal presumption — even when parents disagree.</p>
<h2 id="could-it-be-a-state-law-to-co-parent">Could it be a State Law to Co-Parent?</h2>
<p>This year Kentucky passed a law that made joint physical custody and equal parenting time standard for temporary orders while a divorce is being finalized. Florida approved a bill last year to presume equal time for child custody plans. That bill was later vetoed by the governor. And in Michigan, lawmakers are currently deciding on a bill that would make equal parenting time the starting point in custody decisions. The legal push seems to stem from years of lobbying by fathers&rsquo; rights advocates who argue that men often feel alienated from their children as a result of standard custody decisions in addition to feeling overburdened by child-support obligations. Critics of the bills, including some women’s rights groups, feel these new laws might roll back important protections that exist to keep children and wives safe from abusive or controlling former spouses. Additionally, if this agreement is signed into law, critics of it feel it might take away discretion from judges who currently make their decisions based on the best interest of the children. Laws that require joint physical custody could also lead to the elimination of child support in some states, according to these critics. “The way the system is set up now, two parents enter the courtroom. When they leave, one is a parent, and the other is a visitor,” said Christian Paasch, chair of the National Parents Organization of Virginia. A presumption of shared parenting would replace the “winner takes all” approach currently embedded in the law, he said, and replace it with a new message: “You will both still be parents, and you both matter to your children.”</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is a totally new and different lifestyle, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. This goes for newly divorced parents, as well as parents that have been divorced and co-parenting for years.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hie are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side when scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, there are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are together, try to be friendly. You and your co-parent share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teacher conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to each other and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents and other family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say &ldquo;please&rdquo; and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or other important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements-and-holidays">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements and Holidays</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays and every event that happens during the holidays. This means creating a holiday season schedule. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. There are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

Again</title><link>https://619divorce.com/child-custody/naya-rivera-files-divorce/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2017 13:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://619divorce.com/child-custody/naya-rivera-files-divorce/</guid><description/><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Actress Naya Rivera has filed for divorce for the second time from husband Ryan Dorsey. The two were married for three years and share a son, Josey Hollis Dorsey.</p>
<h2 id="naya-rivera-files-for-divorce-again">Naya Rivera Files for Divorce&hellip; Again</h2>
<p><a href="https://people.com/tv/naya-rivera-allegedly-drinking-out-of-control-before-arrest/">Naya Rivera</a> has filed for divorce from Ryan Dorsey for a second time after more than three years of marriage. The former <em>Glee</em> star filed for divorce citing &ldquo;irreconcilable differences&rdquo; in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday.  Just a week ago the actress was arrested and charged with misdemeanor domestic battery after she allegedly hit Dorsey while the two were taking their son for a walk at the end of November. Rivera, 30, listed the separation date as Nov. 24, according to court documents and has requested joint legal and physical custody of the pair’s 27-month-old son. The court documents show that she has asked the court to terminate both side’s ability to get spousal support. Dorsey, 34, and Rivera were married in July 2014. Rivera first filed for divorce in November 2016 but asked that the filing be dismissed in early October of that same year. Below we discuss options other than divorce, such as annulment and legal separation, as well as what to do if you and your soon-to-be ex share children.</p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>While it may seem that calling off a divorce is a rarity, it&rsquo;s something that happens quite often. For couples thinking about divorce, who are still unsure, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there are other options to consider. There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of if you legally separate or decide to divorce, if you share a child or children, you will need to consider child custody arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="child-custody">Child Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision-making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living together, or even if they never lived together.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>There are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult for a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court.

<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> horror stories. Perhaps a family member or friend is going through one. They fill our news almost daily. When multimillionaire and billionaires divorce no expense or tactic is spared. But even for those with moderate incomes and little to decide on, &ldquo;simple&rdquo; divorces can turn into legal battle royales while bank accounts and emotions are drained. If you&rsquo;re facing what could be a difficult divorce, there are some common avoidable mistakes that you can avoid.</p>
<h2 id="procrastinating"><strong>Procrastinating</strong></h2>
<p>Divorce is hard and it&rsquo;s not uncommon to want to delay it as long as possible. Either subconsciously or consciously, those looking to divorce put off until tomorrow what should be done today. Facing negative emotions, like fear, sadness, or anger can be terrifying. Delaying divorce can help to avoid any unwanted feelings. Others procrastinate because they are unsure about what they want and are thus not ready to make any decisions. Procrastinating will enable you to avoid making decisions. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you are absolved of the responsibility of making those decisions. Procrastinating during a divorce is one of the worst mistakes a person can make. The divorce process is often labor intensive and is typically time sensitive, often requiring time to gather necessary information (bank statements, credit information, etc&hellip;) or uncover relevant evidence. Legal requirements must be satisfied, and in a timely manner, in order for a court to rule on the dissolution of a marriage and the aspects of the marriage that must be decided. Procrastinating can ultimately limit a spouse&rsquo;s options. For example: when one spouse files a divorce motion with the court and sets a hearing date, the other spouse is given notice. Often this is several months notice. But if that spouse procrastinates and does not meet with an attorney until a few weeks or days before the scheduled hearing, they run the risk of an attorney not wanting to take the case because of the lack of time they now possess. Because of this lack of time to prepare for the impending hearing date (not to mention dealing with deadlines that may have already passed), many good attorneys will not on this case. Procrastination can also lead to the disappearance of assets, incurred debts, and depreciation in property values. <strong>How to Avoid Procrastination</strong> To avoid or overcome procrastination you&rsquo;ll want to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> hire a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">family law attorney</a> </li>
<li>gather your support group that will encourage you and hold you accountable, and</li>
<li>come up with a list of desired outcomes that will help you stay on task</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="failure-to-respond"><strong>Failure to Respond</strong> </h2>
<p>Irreparable damage can be caused when you fail to respond to a court summons, your lawyer, and legal documents. Getting divorced is a legal process is governed by state laws and local rules that require, among other things, the submission of specific legal documents and adherence to applicable deadlines. It&rsquo;s against the law to not respond to these things. Always respond to matters of your divorce unless you are completely certain you are not required to. You will need to double check this with your lawyer or with your local court. Many legal documents include if action is required within a certain amount of time. If the documents you receive do not have this information it behooves you to find out through either consulting with your lawyer or researching the applicable laws of your state.</p>
<h2 id="caving-into-pressure"><strong>Caving into Pressure</strong></h2>
<p>During a divorce, when emotions are high, and you&rsquo;re looking to avoid further conflict, it&rsquo;s easy for a person to cave into pressure. Most trial attorneys are trained to exaggerate risks and make things bigger than they are. This can be very difficult to withstand, especially when freedom feels as if it&rsquo;s just a few agreements away. Internal and external pressure fueled by fear, anxiety, your family, therapist, or other outside sources like the judge or your attorney can drive you to make hasty decisions that you otherwise would not have come to. This can mean settling for something that you don&rsquo;t fully agree with. Often times a settlement agreement can be amended, but that is not often the case if it&rsquo;s decided that you willingly agreed in the first place. Because of this, you need to be completely confident in the decisions you make. And that means you cannot cave under pressure. This is not an uncommon thing to happen. This can be especially hard when one spouse has always been the primary breadwinner and the other is left financially vulnerable. Intense litigation can add to the pressure. Often in cases when two spouses are unable to mutually agree to the terms of their divorce, the decision making is turned over to the judge. This can leave a person with a lack of control and completely at the mercy of an overworked judicial system with unpredictable judges. The fear of wanting to avoid this can cause a person to just give in. But there are ways to prepare yourself against caving under pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation. Know what to expect and learn to recognize the internal and external pressures you will face 0r whether by friends or family or your soon-to-be ex.</li>
<li>Consider limiting discussions about your divorce to a small group of trusted and objective people. This might just be your lawyer, therapist, and closest friend.</li>
<li>Keep the strategic and confidential discussions regarding the case completely private. This means only sharing them with your lawyer.</li>
<li>Your friends, family, and even strangers will want to offer their advice. But remember that every divorce is different. Therefore, no two situations will be the same. Chances are your best friends divorce will be very different from your own.</li>
<li>Avoid confrontation with your spouse. If he or she is overbearing or disrespectful of your boundaries, consider limiting communication. This might mean that everything needs to be communicated through your lawyers.</li>
<li>If the pressure is too much to take, you might want to speak to your doctor about possible treatments.</li>
<li>Consider meditation to help calm your nerves, slow your mind, and stay centered during difficult situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Divorce is a life transition. It requires time, attention, and discipline. This will, without a doubt, be heartache and a few tears, some arguments, and heated discussions. Try to find a way to stay focused on the final outcome - freedom from a relationship that was no longer beneficial to you.</p>
<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
<p>Once your divorce is finalized you&rsquo;ll be able to reclaim your life and do the things you might not have done as a result of your marriage. Do things you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. Follow your heart’s desires. By doing so you are offering yourself to the world and finding your own unique way that makes you feel alive. You can choose to stay shut in by the pain of loss and old wounds, but remember that the world will continue to turn. Don&rsquo;t you want to be a part of it?</p>

<p>Basketball player Scottie Pippen and Larsa Pippen have decided to call off their divorce.</p>
<h2 id="scottie-pippen-calls-off-divorce">Scottie Pippen Calls Off Divorce</h2>
<p>According to their attorney Roberta G. Stanley, Bulls basketball player Scottie Pippen, 52,  and his wife, Larsa have decided to call off their divorce. According to Stanley, &ldquo;the dissolution of marriage action has been dismissed and the parties have reconciled.&rdquo; No hearing was held and the couple jointly filed to dismiss the divorce. The couple was wed in 1997 and have four children. Scottie filed for divorce in October 2016. So what happens when a couple decides that marriage is not for them? Or if divorce is not for them?</p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>While it may seem that calling off a divorce is a rarity, it&rsquo;s something that happens quite often. For couples thinking about divorce, who are still unsure, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there are other options to consider. There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>

<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce. In fact, there are various forms of divorce available (of course, you will need to ensure your state laws regarding these types of divorce), including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce.  <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involve a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce. Regardless of if you want a divorce, want a legal separation, need an annulment, or decide to cancel a divorce like the Dempsey&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s always advised that you work with a divorce attorney.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>We all need to work. But what happens when that job interferes with our marriage? Certain jobs are more likely to lead to divorce than others. Check out the following 10 jobs that have the highest rate of divorce associated with them.</p>
<h2 id="10-jobs-with-the-highest-divorce-rate">10 Jobs with the Highest Divorce Rate</h2>
<p><strong>1. Dancer/choreographer</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Bartender</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Massage therapist</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Gaming cage worker</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Extruding machine operators</strong> (someone that works on an assembly line). The theory behind this one is that the repetition, alienation, and highly unstable job causes a psychological disconnect in workers that can lead to divorce. It is also low-paying work performed by people with relatively little education, which can also contribute to the solidity of marriages.</p>

<p><strong>7. Factory worker</strong></p>

<p>It turns out that your marriage and your chance of getting divorced might depend on your education level.</p>
<h2 id="can-your-level-of-education-affect-your-marriage">Can Your Level of Education Affect Your Marriage?</h2>
<p>Professor at Northwestern University and the author of &ldquo;The All-or-Nothing Marriage,&rdquo; Eli J. Finkel, explains that your chance of divorce might just depend on your level of education. As a psychologist, Finkel often studies couples&rsquo; relationships by studying their behaviors while in a lab setting. She then follows up with those same couples over time and tracks how their relationships and marriages progress. After years of research, she&rsquo;s discovered that there might be a link between education level and if a couple stays together. Among people who have college degrees, divorce rates have plummeted since about 1980.  She says, &ldquo;But people who don&rsquo;t have a high school degree, people who are relatively uneducated have a higher divorce rate than ever, and a lower marriage rate, and when they are married, the marriages tend not to be as satisfying.&rdquo; Is there a reason behind this? Finkel proposes that what&rsquo;s &ldquo;going on is it&rsquo;s really difficult to have a productive, happy marriage when your life circumstances are so stressful and when your day-to-day life involves, say three or four bus routes in order to get to your job.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="signs-your-marriage-is-on-the-rocks">Signs Your Marriage Is On The Rocks</h3>
<p>The following signs could indicate that your marriage needs some help.</p>
<h3 id="youre-not-happy">You&rsquo;re not happy.</h3>
<p>Sure, every relationship has its ups and downs but constantly feeling unhappy is a clear sign that this isn&rsquo;t good anymore.</p>
<h3 id="the-majority-of-your-interactions-are-not-positive">The majority of your interactions are not positive.</h3>
<p>According to marriage researcher John Gottman, happy couples have an interaction ratio of 20:1 — that&rsquo;s 20 positive interactions to 1 negative interaction. Conflicted couples have a ratio of 5:1, and couples nearing divorce are .8:1.</p>
<h3 id="you-create-reasons-to-avoid-your-partner">You create reasons to avoid your partner.</h3>
<p>If you are avoiding your partner or creating reasons to avoid your partner, you should consider talking with a marital therapist. Examples are sitting in the car to avoid going inside your house or wanting to hang out more with friends and family instead of at home.</p>
<h3 id="your-friends-or-family-are-encouraging-you-to-end-the-relationship">Your friends or family are encouraging you to end the relationship.</h3>
<p>Friends and family that are closest to you may be able to see things clearly even when you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="your-instincts-are-telling-youits-over">Your instincts are telling you it&rsquo;s over.</h3>
<p>Is your stomach always in a knot? That might just be your gut instinct telling you it&rsquo;s over. Talking with an expert or therapist who can help you weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<h3 id="you-and-your-spouse-live-like-roommates">You and your spouse live like roommates.</h3>
<p>Does he sleep in one room and you sleep in another room? Are you leading separate lives? Are you okay with it? If so, you&rsquo;ve crossed into roommate zone and you need to decide if you want to continue living that way.</p>
<h3 id="everything-feels-hard">Everything feels hard.</h3>
<p>If every interaction feels like a chore or is painful, like deciding on breakfast or when to go to the grocery story, you&rsquo;ll want to consider if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h3 id="one-or-both-have-changed-values-or-priorities">One or both have changed values or priorities.</h3>
<p>In most good relationships, couples value the same &lsquo;big&rsquo; things. But that can change over time. Often times what one person used to value doesn&rsquo;t&rsquo; matter much over time. Lifestyle changes or job opportunities or even religions can cause people to change. Unless you are both able to adapt, it can be a tough thing to overcome.</p>
<h3 id="sudden-changes-in-behavior">Sudden changes in behavior.</h3>
<p>If one partner suddenly drops lots of weight and takes a renewed interest in their appearance or maybe starts spending a lot of time away from home, you might need to take a closer look into what could be an &lsquo;outside reason&rsquo; for this.</p>
<h2 id="are-these-signs-ringing-a-bell"><strong>Are these signs ringing a bell?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have more than 2-3 of the signs listed above you might want to spend some time to sit down and have an open conversation with your spouse. If that is not possible, you might want to consider speaking with a marital therapist that can advise you on how to have an open conversation with your spouse. If after reading these signs, and you decide that you want a divorce and that there is no way you can work things out with your spouse, you should consider calling a family law attorney.</p>
<h2 id="the-divorce-process">The Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different, and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>

<p>Divorce can turn friends into enemies. A better and less stressful solution might be a <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">collaborative divorce</a>. It can also save couples time and money. According to attorney Joryn Jenkins, &ldquo;By the end of the divorce trial, spouses can become enemies. Litigation makes people be mean to each other. … But people usually don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s another option, and lawyers don&rsquo;t tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-collaborative-divorce">What is a Collaborative Divorce?</h2>
<p>A collaborative divorce includes a team of four people: a lawyer for each spouse, a mental health coach, and a financial professional. They all work together to create a divorce agreement which includes alimony, the division of marital property, and child visitation and support. A collaborative divorce is a face-to-face litigation process where each spouse gives their opinion in order to reach emotional as well as financial and legal solutions. &ldquo;The rewards of collaborative divorce are huge,&rdquo; according to attorney Joryn Jenkins. &ldquo;You learn to work out issues and say things in a better way.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="a-collaborative-divorce-is-shorter-and-costs-less">A Collaborative Divorce is Shorter and Costs Less</h3>
<p>A collaborative divorce may save you both time and money. While a regular divorce that goes to a trial may cost $100,000, the average collaborative divorce is about $32,000. In addition to less money, the average collaborative divorce lasts three to four months to settle compared to a divorce trial that can drag on for years. Because a judge makes the final decision in a trial dtheree, thise isn&rsquo;t much control when it comes to the process, timing, or outcome of the case. &ldquo;People are raiding their retirement accounts just to pay for divorces,&rdquo; said collaborative attorney Rackham Karlsson. &ldquo;Going to court can be more expensive, more time intensive and corrosive for children.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="collaborative-divorce-a-good-alternative">Collaborative Divorce a Good Alternative</h3>

<h2 id="options-instead-of-divorce">Options Instead of Divorce</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re debating if you should get divorced or not, there are additional options for you to consider.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-and-annulment">Legal Separation and Annulment</h3>
<p>You might not need to file for divorce. There are two other options: legal separation or <em>annulment</em> (also called a <em>nullity</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal separation</strong>. This is a a legal process, granted in the form of a court order, by which a married couple can remain legally married while not living togethis. Some couples use this as a formal break, during which they have some time to decide if they would like to continue the marriage. Thise are often religious, insurance, tax, or othis reasons for wanting a legal separation instead of a formal dissolution. With a legal separation you and your spouse will remain married, but the court (or you) can divide your property and issue orders relating to child custody, visitation, child support and spousal support, and, if necessary, a restraining order.</li>
<li><strong>Annulment</strong>. Being granted an annulment makes it as if your marriage never existed. Thise are specific requirements you will need to meet to have your marriage annulled. These include being a minor without the consent of your parents or guardian during the time of the marriage, or if certain types of fraud or deceit were involved. An annulment requires you appear in court.</li>
</ul>
<p>The residency requirements for these are less harsh than standard divorces. Eithis of these can be obtained without having lived in California for six months or the county you are filing in for three months prior to filing, as is required for a standard divorce.</p>
<h3 id="summary-dissolution">Summary Dissolution</h3>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">In California</a> you are able to receive a simplified dissolution of marriage if you meet certain requirements. This is called a _summary dissolutio_n. This process requires less paperwork and you will not have to appear in court. You are eligible for a summary dissolution if you and your spouse have agreed in writing to a division of your assets and debts and if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been married for five years or less.</li>
<li>You have no children from the relationship.</li>
<li>Neithis of you own a home or othis real estate.</li>
<li>The value of all community property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>The value of eithis party&rsquo;s separate property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>Your combined debt does not exceed $4,000, except for auto loans.</li>
<li>Both of you waive spousal support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both spouses agree to these terms, you can be granted a summary dissolution. This process can be as easy as filling out a form and turning it in to your local clerk&rsquo;s office. Still, you might want to have a family law attorney review the forms before you file them.</p>
<h3 id="amount-of-time">Amount of Time</h3>
<p>In California, the mandatory waiting period required is 6 months. No couple, regardless of how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; their divorce is can be divorced faster than 6 months. This is the time it takes for the state to change your status from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to single&quot;.  You will be able to get all your paperwork turned in to the court and your divorce judgment approved, but the divorce itself will not be final until at least 6 months after the initial petition. In some cases, those that require a lot of things to be required, a divorce can take years. This is based on how much you decided to disagree and agree on. </p>

<p>Chrissy Teigan, wife of singer-songwriter John Legend, recently told <em>US Weekly</em> that she&rsquo;d never divorce him because she never wanted to see another woman with &ldquo;her baby.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="why-chrissy-teigan-isnt-getting-divorced"><strong>Why Chrissy Teigan Isn&rsquo;t Getting Divorced</strong></h2>
<p>As Teigan told the magazine, &ldquo;I told him the No. 1 reason we are not getting divorced is because I refuse to see another woman with my baby.” Regardless of whether or not you decide to get divorced, or decide to NOT get divorced, you&rsquo;ll want to have a gauge of your relationship.  </p>
<h3 id="signs-your-marriage-is-on-the-rocks">Signs Your Marriage Is On The Rocks</h3>
<p>The following signs could indicate that your marriage needs some help.</p>
<h3 id="youre-not-happy">You&rsquo;re not happy.</h3>
<p>Sure, every relationship has its ups and downs but constantly feeling unhappy is a clear sign that this isn&rsquo;t good anymore.</p>
<h3 id="the-majority-of-your-interactions-are-not-positive">The majority of your interactions are not positive.</h3>
<p>According to marriage researcher John Gottman, happy couples have an interaction ratio of 20:1 — that&rsquo;s 20 positive interactions to 1 negative interaction. Conflicted couples have a ratio of 5:1, and couples nearing divorce are .8:1.</p>
<h3 id="you-create-reasons-to-avoid-your-partner">You create reasons to avoid your partner.</h3>
<p>If you are avoiding your partner or creating reasons to avoid your partner, you should consider talking with a marital therapist. Examples are sitting in the car to avoid going inside your house or wanting to hang out more with friends and family instead of at home.</p>
<h3 id="your-friends-or-family-are-encouraging-you-to-end-the-relationship">Your friends or family are encouraging you to end the relationship.</h3>
<p>Friends and family that are closest to you may be able to see things clearly even when you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="your-instincts-are-telling-youits-over">Your instincts are telling you it&rsquo;s over.</h3>
<p>Is your stomach always in a knot? That might just be your gut instinct telling you it&rsquo;s over. Talking with an expert or therapist who can help you weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<h3 id="you-and-your-spouse-live-like-roommates">You and your spouse live like roommates.</h3>
<p>Does he sleep in one room and you sleep in another room? Are you leading separate lives? Are you okay with it? If so, you&rsquo;ve crossed into roommate zone and you need to decide if you want to continue living that way.</p>
<h3 id="everything-feels-hard">Everything feels hard.</h3>
<p>If every interaction feels like a chore or is painful, like deciding on breakfast or when to go to the grocery story, you&rsquo;ll want to consider if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h3 id="one-or-both-have-changed-values-or-priorities">One or both have changed values or priorities.</h3>
<p>In most good relationships, couples value the same &lsquo;big&rsquo; things. But that can change over time. Often times what one person used to value doesn&rsquo;t&rsquo; matter much over time. Lifestyle changes or job opportunities or even religions can cause people to change. Unless you are both able to adapt, it can be a tough thing to overcome.</p>
<h3 id="sudden-changes-in-behavior">Sudden changes in behavior.</h3>
<p>If one partner suddenly drops lots of weight and takes a renewed interest in their appearance or maybe starts spending a lot of time away from home, you might need to take a closer look into what could be an &lsquo;outside reason&rsquo; for this.</p>
<h2 id="are-these-signs-ringing-a-bell"><strong>Are these signs ringing a bell?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have more than 2-3 of the signs listed above you might want to spend some time to sit down and have an open conversation with your spouse. If that is not possible, you might want to consider speaking with a marital therapist that can advise you on how to have an open conversation with your spouse. If after reading these signs, and you decide that you want a divorce and that there is no way you can work things out with your spouse, you should consider calling a family law attorney.</p>
<h2 id="the-divorce-process">The Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different, and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure.

<p>Chris Pratt and Anna Faris are seeking couples counseling. The two announced their divorce on August 6 after close to 8 years of marriage.</p>
<h2 id="chris-pratt-and-anna-faris-seek-couples-counseling">Chris Pratt and Anna Faris Seek Couples Counseling</h2>
<p>According to a source close to the couple, the stars are receiving counseling for the sake of their 5-year-old son, Jack, in an effort to create a successful &ldquo;coparenting&rdquo; situation. Pratt, 38, and Faris, 40, met on the set of their 2007 film, <em>Take Me Home Tonight.</em> At the time of filming, Faris was still married to her first husband, actor Ben Indra**.** During a 2014 <em>Esquire</em> magazine interview, Pratt said that he did not to pursue Faris because he knew she was married. When Faris and Indra split in 2008, Pratt decided he was going to marry her, he said. Over the course of their marriage, Pratt and Faris often spoke openly about their marriage and parenthood. During an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in January 2015, Pratt said that he and Faris have a “remarkable kid.” In 2014, Faris told DeGeneres she was “proud of [herself]” for having “great taste” in choosing Pratt. “He’s a great family man. I am so proud of his success and everything. But he’s more importantly a great person, and he’s got a great heart.”</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-co-parenting-relationship">Creating a Co-Parenting Relationship</h2>
<p>Becoming a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">co-parent</a> is difficult, so how can you effectively do it? When people decide to divorce, very often it&rsquo;s their children that take the separation the hardest. When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all othis aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is totally new and different from what you might expect, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. Now that you&rsquo;re divorced and completely ended your relationship, with all legal aspects neatly tied up, you can continue on with your new single life and never have to deal with your ex again! That is unless you have children. If you do, then you need to put the breaks on a bit. If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be place in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-is-to-set-boundaries">Step Two is to Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, thise are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, thise are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are togethis try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachis conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each othis and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, thise are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, thise are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are togethis try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachis conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each othis and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Celebrity divorce seems to be in the news every day, whethis it&rsquo;s a real divorce or just a rumored one! George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin were married only a few weeks before divorce rumors started. Wikipedia even has a page devoted to &ldquo;Hollywood Marriage.&rdquo; But do celebrities really get divorced more often? Or do we just hear about it more because they&rsquo;re in the limelight?</p>
<h2 id="the-hollywood-marriage">The &ldquo;Hollywood Marriage&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hollywood marriage&rdquo; in Hollywood&rsquo;s golden era meant high society marriage between celebrities in the movie industry. Glitz and glamour were the theme of these marriages, but today the term also carries the negative connotation of a short duration marriage ending in eithis separation or divorce. This negative viewpoint of &ldquo;Hollywood Marriage&rdquo; started to get sour by the 1930&rsquo;s, and hasn&rsquo;t sweetened up much since then.</p>
<h3 id="media-influence-and-celebrity-divorce">Media Influence and Celebrity Divorce</h3>
<p>People and the media are often quick to point their fingers as these failed celebrity marriages, giving the skewed impresson that &ldquo;Hollywood Marriages&rdquo; are less successful than non-celebrity marriages. In 1972 Bob Thomas of the Associated Press stated that celebrity marriages that last are usually ignored by the media. For example, Bob and Dolores Hope were married 69 years and Rosalind Russell and Frederick Brisson were married 35 years.</p>
<h3 id="is-the-faults-with-the-celebrities">Is the Faults with the Celebrities</h3>
<p>Even if the media isn&rsquo;t to blame, some believe the fault it part of Hollywood&rsquo;s culture, or perhaps the personal faults of the celebrities themselves. Some think weddings are just used as publicity stunts, whise egotism and celebrity immaturity fuel the culture. With so many opportunities to stray as celebrities work on different projects, high levels of infidelity and promiscuity also fuel the high divorce rates. Bee Wilson of The Daily Telegraph wrote &ldquo;Hollywood marriages&rdquo; often are based on unrealistic dreams and called celebrities &ldquo;permanent children.&rdquo; However, she also indicated that on the counterpoint of his view, classic Hollywood couples such as Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart and Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward were definitely the exception.</p>
<h3 id="opinions-of-celebrities-on-divorce">Opinions of Celebrities on Divorce</h3>
<p>Like everybody else, actors and entertainer also have differing opinions when it comes to the Hollywood divorce rate. Anne Baxter has stated Hollywood is &ldquo;the most difficult place in America for marriage&rdquo; due to the &ldquo;terrible extremes of success and failure&rdquo; the spouses face with their careers. Othiss feel it&rsquo;s because of the magnifying glass aspect the Hollywood marriages deal with. Mitzi Gaynor said in a 1964 interview, &ldquo;Everything we do is magnified.&rdquo; He also concluded that &ldquo;you have to be a little off-center to get into this business in the first place.&rdquo; This is one reason why celebrities such as Harrison Ford try so hard to keep their private lives private. But in spite of this, he&rsquo;s on his third marriage.</p>
<h3 id="divorce-rate-statistics">Divorce Rate Statistics</h3>
<p>With so many people on scripted television, talk shows, reality shows, etc., the question many people have is who exactly can be considered a &ldquo;celebrity.&rdquo; A Radford University study found &ldquo;dancers and choreographiss,&rdquo; perhaps ones like the professional dancers on &ldquo;Dancing With the Stars,&rdquo; currently have the highest divorce rate percentage. &ldquo;Entertainers and performers, sports and related workers, all othis&rdquo; come in at above average at tenth. &ldquo;Nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides&rdquo; are ninth and &ldquo;Baggage porters and concierges&rdquo; rake eleventh. A Forbes article concurred with this report, indicating that &ldquo;professional athletes and entertainers&rdquo; combined have a high rate of divorce. One athlete that comes to mind is Tiger Woods and his messy divorce.</p>
<h3 id="some-famously-short-marriages">Some Famously Short Marriages</h3>
<p>While some Hollywood marriages have been short, thise are some that are so short they were almost non-existent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Britney Spears and Jason Allen Alexander&rsquo;s Las Vegas marriage was annulled 56 hours after the &ldquo;I Do&rsquo;s&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock&rsquo;s marriage lasted only six months.</li>
<li>Drew Barrymore and Jeremy Thomas&rsquo;s marriage ended after 19 days.</li>
<li>Sophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray&rsquo;s journey to divorce lasted longer than their five month marriage. In September 2005 they announced their separation. In February 2006 Bush tried unsuccessfully to get an annulment. Finally, in December 2006, she was granted a divorce.</li>
<li>Milla Jovovich and Shawn Andrews&rsquo; marriage in 1992 was annulled two months later.</li>
<li>Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries&rsquo; marriage lasted a whole 72 days before filing for divorce.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-celebrity-divorce-reasons">Potential Celebrity Divorce Reasons</h3>
<p>Thise are many factors involved in a Hollywood divorce, which is why it may seem so commonplace. Some factors include busy schedules that keep the spouses apart for months at a time. As in all marriages, things usually get real really fast. Instead of a flawless leading man, or picture perfect woman, they suddenly realize they both have flaws, bad breath in the morning, and a few scars hise and thise, not to mention bad habits like never closing a drawer, leaving the toilet seat up, or picking up after themselves. As a celebrity, temptations are also highis. As an actor, a job requirement is to kiss your othis actor in scenes. While they&rsquo;re only stage kisses, the pretend passion frequently become real passion. After a couple of seasons on The Americans, Keri Russell and Matthews Rhys decided to move in togethis in real life, after she divorced his husband. In addition to on-screen romances turning into off-screen romances, fan is short for &ldquo;fanatic&rdquo; and fans fanatically throw themselves at the object of their affection. The bane of the biggest stars. Elvis had to deal with it and today celebrities like Justin Bieber. With so many people telling you you&rsquo;re wonderful and they love you, its difficult for some to keep their feet on the ground. Why stay with somebody who makes you take the garbage out or do the dishes when you can have somebody who will do it for you instead. Because you&rsquo;re just so incredibly awesome!</p>
<h3 id="general-divorce-rates">General Divorce Rates</h3>
<p>The divorce rate also depends on if it&rsquo;s the first, second, or third marriage, according to the following statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>First marriage divorce rate = 41% - 50%;</li>
<li>Second marriage divorce rate = 60% - 67%;</li>
<li>Third marriage divorce rate = 73% - 74%.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to research, couple who have children have a somewhat lower breakup rate compared to couples who don&rsquo;t have children. Anothis interesting statistic is that children whose parents were divorced were four times more likely to have their own marriage end in divorce compared to children whose parents remained married.</p>
<h3 id="drop-in-current-divorce-rate">Drop in Current Divorce rate</h3>
<p>Compared to what was previously thought, over the last few decades divorce rates have been dropping. Marriages are lasting longer in the 21st century versus the marriage success rate in the 1990s. As more people decide to follow the newest relationship trend of living togethis as partners rathis than marrying, the divorce rate is expected to continue declining.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-after-i-do---considering-divorce">&ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t&rdquo; After &ldquo;I Do&rdquo; - Considering Divorce</h3>
<p>When people decide to say &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; they never think it may end in &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&rdquo; and divorce. Even once the decision is made, it&rsquo;s hard, and sometimes traumatic, to think about hiring a divorce attorney. Marriage is always difficult, whethis you&rsquo;re a normal Joe, or Hollywood A-lister Joe. Thise are valid reasons for divorce, such as infidelity, but sometimes it just because the couple have just grown apart. Thise are no magic formula made up of guides or rules to have a successful marriage. If thise was it would be given to every couple when they get married. While some couples manage to get through the rough and tough spots in the road, othiss decide the only answer is divorce. Even when you decide divorce is the only answer, you may still have doubts and questions as to whethis it&rsquo;s the right solution and if you should take that next step.</p>
<h3 id="some-questions-to-help-with-divorce">Some Questions to Help With Divorce</h3>

<p>When you decide to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">end your marriage</a>, it can feel like the end of your financial freedom. How will you handle child support payments or even manage to get food on the table now that you are down to one source of income? It can feel impossible. But just as divorce does not mean the end of your life, it also does not mean the end of your financial freedom.</p>
<h2 id="the-end-of-amarriage">The End of a Marriage</h2>
<p>There is nothing easy about ending a marriage. You&rsquo;re going to feel out of place for a while. Everything is new. Chances are you&rsquo;ve had to rearrange your schedule to now pick up the kids from their dad&rsquo;s house every othis weekend. It might mean you&rsquo;re not spending Christmas with your parents so that the children can spend Hanukkah with their mom&rsquo;s family. You might need to set up an automatic child support and spousal support payment to your ex husband for every third week of the month. Or maybe you need to call your now ex wife to make sure that she drops off the soccer cleats at the school that your son left at his house over the weekend. Regardless of what the situation is, things have changed. And that means your financial situation has. But just because everything is different, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should steer your course for financial ruin. Yes, losing a second income is hard. It can be especially hard if you were living off of one income and now have to go back to the land of the full-time worker. These are some tips and tricks that can help ensure that your divorce doesn&rsquo;t translate to financial ruin.</p>
<h2 id="gather-resources">Gather Resources</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go it alone,&rdquo; says Mike Lynch, vice president of strategic markets at Hartford Funds. &ldquo;Build a team today – a qualified team of legal, tax and investment professionals. Maybe it&rsquo;s your current investment professional, or you may seek a new one that understands your situation better.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re going to want to put together a legal team to help you reach a settlement in regards to child custody and property division. But you might also want to consider bringing on a team of financial professionals to advise you on things such as how your taxes will need to be filed (Alimony and child support can have large financial impact), in addition to how to make money work for you now that there is only you to help pay the bills.</p>
<h2 id="specifics-to-keep-in-mind">Specifics To Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>Certified divorce financial analyst Eva Sachs, Emily McBurney, an attorney and qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO) expert, and certified divorce financial analyst Donna Cheswick also have this advice:</p>
<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<p>Sachs says the first step toward financial independence is balancing your income with your expenses. This can be hard to do if you&rsquo;ve never had to in the past. He advises you sit down and look at how much money is coming in from various avenues like work, alimony and/or child support payments, and then assess how much of that is going toward living expenses. &ldquo;Think of it as a spending plan rathis than a budget,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Knowing whise your money goes is key, especially after divorce. Thise will be many new expenses you might not have thought about prior to your divorce; this is a critical time to refrain from spending money you don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; <strong>Change Your Benefactors</strong> Most likely your spouse was your main benefactor during the marriage, but that is probably not going to be the case moving forward. To remedy this, one of the first things you need to do, is update the beneficiary on your life insurance and retirement accounts. &ldquo;Review all of your accounts and insurance policies and change the beneficiaries. A divorce does <em>not</em> automatically terminate your former spouse’s rights to be the beneficiary on your retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies –- even though your divorce decree might say that your former spouse has waived all rights to the benefits,&rdquo; says McBurney. &ldquo;You will need to formally submit a change of beneficiary form to each financial institution. Othiswise, the benefit will be paid to whoever is listed on their forms at the time of your death &ndash; regardless of your divorce.&rdquo; Take this opportunity to reflect on the people in your life that are around to support you and encourage you. This can be a hard step, changing your beneficiary, because you&rsquo;ve never imagined having to remove your spouse. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want to revise your will, says Cheswick. &ldquo;Meet with an estate planning attorney to discuss your state’s laws regarding possible updates to your will, power of attorney and advanced directives,&rdquo; she suggests. &ldquo;You want to be sure that your former spouse is no longer entitled to any distribution in the event of your death. And if your settlement agreement requires one party to maintain life insurance on the othis, then thise needs to be a method in place to be sure this is actually occurring. Just because the former spouse says they will do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are following through.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="property-division">Property Division</h3>
<p>Marital property division is governed by state laws, but can still get contentious. You will need to check with a family law attorney to see if you live in an equitable distribution state or a community property state. There are four steps to dividing marital property:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify assets owned by you and the assets owned by your spouse</li>
<li>Categorize all assets as &ldquo;marital&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; property (an attorney can help you determine this)</li>
<li>Assign a value to each asset (you might need an appraiser for thiss)</li>
<li>Devise a plan for the division of assets that is in accordance with state laws</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consider-selling-shared-property">Consider Selling Shared Property</h3>
<p>Instead of fighting over who will retain ownership of the family property, consider selling it and splitting the proceeds. This is a way for each spouse to &ldquo;break even.&rdquo; When it comes to a secondary home, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much more effective to sell the house and distribute the proceeds to the children,&rdquo; says Ric Edelman, chairman and CEO of Edelman Financial Services. &ldquo;You get into the issue of fights amongst the kids – issues of maintenance, repairs and upkeep.&rdquo;  after their divorce is finalized and thise are still outstanding items which have not been resolved,&quot; she said. &ldquo;Remember that the agreement is a legally binding contract that you both signed and agreed to uphold. If one party is failing to comply with the terms of the contract then the othis party has every right to take steps to ensure their compliance including going back to court to have the agreement enforced.&rdquo;   <strong>Plan for Retirement</strong> As the divorce gets closer to being finalized, Sachs advises looking to ways of maximizing your retirement savings. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let divorce stop you from planning for your future,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Investing in your 401K plan will allow you to save for retirement. You can begin by saving a small amount each week and then let it build slowly or make payroll contributions that match your employer contributions. Don&rsquo;t stop thinking of the future!&rdquo; Just because you are no longer going to be sharing your golden years with your ex-spouse, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have the time of your life. Getting your financial situation under control is the first step to taking back your life and claiming your bright future.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure.

<p>After messy <a href="https://619divorce.com/">divorces</a> you don&rsquo;t want anyone to think highly of your ex - including your children. It can be hard not to bad-mouth your ex, and even harder to handle it when your children express their love about your ex. The truth is, you need to allow your child to express love for the ex you might absolutely hate.</p>
<h2 id="allow-your-child-to-express-love-for-your-ex">Allow Your Child to Express Love For Your Ex</h2>
<p>is to &ldquo;put your child first.&rdquo; Many times children feel responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, so it&rsquo;s important to put them first and make sure they know it wasn&rsquo;t their fault. This simple tip will help put things in perspective to focus on what&rsquo;s important as you navigate co-parenting. One factor that you&rsquo;ll need to remember is that your kids still love their other parent. Forbidding or discouraging your children from expressing love or talking about their other parent while they are with you might feel tempting. But the truth is, it&rsquo;s most likely to backfire. Rules like this often cause a child to feel as if they cannot speak freely around you. When this happens, you might soon find that your child isn&rsquo;t just not speaking to you about the other parent, but also not speaking to you about other important things. Once the door of open and healthy parent-child communication is closed, it can be a hard one to re-open. What this means is that you will need to find a way to be okay with your ex, and to acknowledge that they are a part of your child&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 id="putting-your-childs-needs-first">Putting Your Child&rsquo;s Needs First</h2>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-co-parent">How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>Co-parenting is all about establishing a working relationship between you and your ex. If you two are not able to come to a friendly arrangement on your own, it is always advised that you work with a mediator that can help you establish some guidelines and rules.</p>
<p>Here are some things you should iron out when coming up with a co-parenting plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan. Differences should be set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other of any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-considerations-for-co-parenting">Additional Considerations For Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>When all of you are together try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teacher conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each other and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say &ldquo;please&rdquo; and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text.  Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or other important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. There are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-co-parent-relationship">Create a Co-Parent Relationship</h3>
<p>Creating relationship with your co-parenting can be difficult. You may decide working with a mediator is the best option to making an agreement. Once you establish ground rules for yourself and how to maintain the relationship, over time it becomes easier. Creating a flexible schedule may help get to these &ldquo;easier&rdquo; moments. Even though there may be easier moments, there will be times when things feel impossible. Finding balance with your co-parent may help you both become better people and better parents to your children. By being cooperative with your co-parent, you establish a patter of life for your children which can carry into the future. The number one priority you and your co-parent need to do is to make sure you put the best interests of your child first.

<p>In a recent turn of events, it appears that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie might have decided to NOT get divorced.</p>
<h2 id="brad-and-angelina-might-not-be-getting-divorced">Brad and Angelina Might NOT Be Getting Divorced</h2>
<p>During a recent interview with <em>GQ Magazine</em>, Pitt opened up about what might have been the reason for his and Jolie&rsquo;s initial decision to split up. As Pitt said regarding his divorce, “I was boozing too much. It’s just become a problem. And I’m really happy it’s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I’ve got my feelings in my fingertips again.” He also revealed that he&rsquo;s in therapy and has stopped drinking and that much of the drama was &ldquo;self-inflicted.&rdquo;   For many, the decision to get divorced is not made lightly. Therefore, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to say they&rsquo;re getting divorced, and then decide to stay together. This is also very true for many celebrity couples. While many celebs divorce, many often decide to divorce and then change their minds.</p>
<h2 id="when-celebs-call-off-divorce">When Celebs Call Off Divorce</h2>
<p>From Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones to Brian Austin Green and Megan Fox, many celebrity couples decide that divorce is not for them. Ozzy Osbourne and Sharon also decided to stay together after publicly announcing a split. So what happens when a couple decides that marriage is not for them? Or if divorce is not for them?</p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>While it may seem that calling off a divorce is a rarity, it&rsquo;s something that happens quite often. For couples thinking about divorce, who are still un-sure, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there are other options to consider. There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="divorcehttps619divorcecomsan-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer-san-diego-collaborative-law--divorce-mediation-lawyer"><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">Divorce</a></h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge eithis. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children togethis, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce. In fact, there are various forms of divorce available (of course, you will need to ensure your state laws regarding these types of divorce), including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce.  <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involved a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations, and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce. Regardless of if you want a divorce, want a legal separation, need an annulment, or decide to cancel a divorce like the Dempsey&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s always advised that you work with a divorce attorney.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure.

<p>Actors Chris Pratt and Anna Faris have decided to separate, according to a Facebook post on Pratt&rsquo;s personal page. The couple, who were married in July 2009, have one son, 4-year-old Jack.</p>
<h2 id="chris-pratt-and-anna-faris-are-separating">Chris Pratt and Anna Faris are Separating</h2>
<p>“Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating,” the &ldquo;Guardians of the Galaxy&rdquo; actor wrote. “We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.”</p>
<p>The couple met on the set of their 2007 film, <em>Take Me Home Tonight.</em> At the time of filming, Faris was still married to her first husband, actor Ben Indra**.** During a 2014 <em>Esquire</em> magazine interview, Pratt said that he did not to pursue Faris because he knew she was married. When Faris and Indra split in 2008, Pratt decided he was going to marry her, he said.</p>
<p>The couple unknowingly grew up 20 minutes apart from each other in Washington state, but as Pratt pointed out in the interview, he regarded Faris to be his “twin soul.”</p>
<p>Over the course of their marriage, Pratt and Faris often spoke openly about their marriage and parenthood. During an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in January 2015, Pratt said that he and Faris have a “remarkable kid.” In 2014, Faris told DeGeneres she was “proud of [herself]” for having “great taste” in choosing Pratt. “He’s a great family man. I am so proud of his success and everything. But he’s more importantly a great person, and he’s got a great heart.”</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation-and-divorce">Legal Separation and Divorce</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand the difference between legal separation and divorce. During a legal separation, couples live apart but are still technically married. A divorce ends the marriage, meaning that both spouse&rsquo;s legal statuses are returned to &ldquo;single.&rdquo; Legal separation can serve as a cooling off period for spouses and does not always turn to divorce. During legal separation, a couple needs to negotiate how expenses will be divided and who will assume certain financial responsibilities, such as mortgage payments, car payments, debt payments. Additionally, if there are children involved, a couple will need to work out child visitation and custody arrangements. The decisions made during legal separation are typically the decisions that are kept should the marriage be officially dissolved via divorce. There&rsquo;s a lot of &ldquo;new territory&rdquo; when it comes to legal separation and how to act. Whether the legal separation ends in reconciliation or <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>, there are some rules of engagement you should follow. Here are some tips to consider.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="contained-in-the-legal-separation-agreement">Contained in the Legal Separation Agreement</h2>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement.

<h2 id="deciding-on-divorce">Deciding on Divorce</h2>
<p>If you do decide to go through with divorce following your legal separation, or if you just want to skip the separation and start the divorce process, a divorce attorney will be able to walk you through the process. This process includes some of the following: spousal support, child custody, and property division. Below we discuss these three aspects, and why working with a divorce attorney can help you arrive at a smoothis outcome.</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h2>
<p>Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intenced to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to anothis.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In othis words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must proved your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whethis you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determinig spousal support, the court usually requires the highis earner, whethis they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h2 id="child-custody">Child Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.

<p>As the future of health care hangs in limbo, so do many couples&rsquo; marriages. For couples across the nation, the determination to repeal and replace health care will have far reaching influence on whether or not they should stay married in order to keep their health insurance.  According to financial planners and divorce attorneys, the health care uncertainty being felt in Washington, D.C. is also causing uncertainty amongst couples evaluating if now is the time for a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="to-divorce-or-not-to-divorce-a-health-care-dilemma">To Divorce or Not To Divorce: A Health Care Dilemma</h2>
<p>In couples dealing with pre-existing conditions, the question of if Washington Republicans will repeal or replace health care is a big deal. When it comes to health care, according to Lili A. Vasileff, founder, and president of Divorce and Money Matters, “We don’t know what will be in place, what it will cost, and if you can even get it.&quot; Until we have answers, couples across the nation are choosing to stay married rather than divorce. Many are also drafting post-nuptial agreements that clarify the separation of assets and terms of possible future divorce proceedings but leaves the couples still legally married. Other couples are simply stalling when it comes to sending in divorce paperwork to be processed. In the past, the common practice was for a couple to legally separate in order to retain coverage for ill spouses.  Many insurance companies have now stopped honoring that type of agreement, according to Andrew Vaughn, a Chicago divorce attorney and founder of NuVorce. Additionally, the cost of health insurance often factors into the calculation of alimony, also known as spousal support. Due to the fact that a determination has not been reached, many attorneys are at a loss when it comes to determining appropriate amounts of spousal support awards.</p>

While a family law attorney can provide you with specifics about your situation, hise are a few general things to know, including tax laws, awarding of spousal support, and what would happen if spousal support payments are not made. Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intenced to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to anothis.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In othis words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must proved your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whethis you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determinig spousal support, the court usually requires the highis earner, whethis they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-financial-situation-changes-affect-spousal-support">How do Financial Situation Changes Affect Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The length of spousal support payments could also depend on whethis the spouse who is getting the support has any changes in their financial situation, such as starting a new job or getting a raise. The purpose for spousal support is to make sure the spouse receiving it has financial safeguards. If the spouse receiving support doesn&rsquo;t need it anymore in order to maintain their financial stability, the court may decide that they no longer need the spousal support they are receiving.</p>
<h3 id="spousal-support-and-divorce-decision-tax-strategy">Spousal Support and Divorce Decision Tax Strategy</h3>
<p>Thise are certain basic tax laws you have to keep in min during and after your divorce if you&rsquo;re going to be paying or receiving spousal support. The bottom line if receiving spousal support is that you have to declare it as income on your taxes. Othis the othis hand, if you&rsquo;re paying it, you get to deduct it on your taxes. Spousal support is different from child support since child support is neithis declared nor deducted on your taxes.</p>
<h3 id="taxes-and-divorce-ruling">Taxes and Divorce Ruling</h3>
<p>When calculating spousal support (i.e., alimony) agreements, you have to remember this rule since it impacts the bottom line of your finances. The decision and ruling reflects your intentions when it&rsquo;s time to do your taxes. For example, you may decide that the spouse who is paying the spousal support should agree to pay the tax liability of the spouse who is receiving the spousal support. You should discuss this with your family law attorney during the hearing for your spousal support determination. If you&rsquo;re still on good terms with your spouse, it would be helpful to discuss and decide on the best tax deal that would work for you both. If you&rsquo;re not on good times, this might be difficult to come to a mutual tax deal decision, but if you can manage come to a mutual agreement it will save both of you lots of time and headaches when it&rsquo;s tax season. If you get spousal support you should prepare for a potential impace when tax time comes. Your ex isn&rsquo;t able to withhold income taxes from your support checks, which means you have to account for the taxes when you file your tax return. Because of this you may want to consider paying taxes on a quarterly basis, which will save you from being hit with a big tax liability when April 15th comes around. If you&rsquo;re paying spousal support remember you can deduct the payments on your income taxes. However, you can&rsquo;t deduct child support or any property distribution. The IRS frequently scrutinizes spousal support payments for the first three years you make the payments. This is to make sure that you&rsquo;re not disguising the spousal support payments as property distribution or something else related to your divorce. A divorce attorney understands all the ins and outs of tax issues relating to divorce, and can help you understand the issues during the spousal support hearings and afterward, after you begin to make the payments.</p>
<h3 id="not-keeping-up-with-spousal-support-payments">Not Keeping Up with Spousal Support Payments</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual to fall behind when it comes to spousal support payments. This can be cause by various reasons including, job loss, being unable to get a job, or just negligence. If you&rsquo;re receiving the payments, your whole life can be put in disarray and have a damaging affect on it. Hise are some suggestions if your ex spouse falls behind on spousal support payments of fails to make them.</p>
<h3 id="not-receiving-court-ordered-alimony-payments">Not Receiving Court-Ordered Alimony Payments?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re court-ordered alimony payments aren&rsquo;t being received, attempt to discover the reason. See if your ex lost their job recently. Perhaps they were injured and unable to work. If these are the reasons, try to see if the two of you can work out a plan that will make up the lost payments as well as future payments. An attorney can provide an unbiased opinion when it comes to situations like this, and will also provide any legal proof in case you need to take your unpaying ex to court.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-avoid-not-receiving-alimony-payments">How to Avoid Not Receiving Alimony Payments</h3>
<p>If your ex can make spousal payments, has a job, has no injuries, and just doesn&rsquo;t want to pay the court-ordered alimony payments, then you need the legal help of a divorce attorney. A motion will have to be filed in court requesting that a judge order your spouse to pay the past-due alimony payments. The motion also includes the agreement requiring them to keep current on future alimony payments. You should work with a family law attorney experienced in these matters who can draft a legal motion regarding this. The attorney will also be able to serve in court as your representative.</p>
<h3 id="consequences-of-alimony-non-payment">Consequences of Alimony Non-Payment</h3>
<p>Thise are a number of punishments and fines the court can order for delinquent spouses. The laws governing deliquent spousal payments include various consequences that are different from one state to anothis, but they generally include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contempt charges for the spouse, including fines and jail time.</li>
<li>Withholding the spouse&rsquo;s income. This requires the deliquent spouse’s employer to withhold the spousal support payment amount their paycheck. Then the money is then sent directly to the spouse who is supposed to receive it.</li>
<li>Writ of Execution, which is when the judge gives a portion of the bank accounts or othis assets of the delinquent spouse to the spouse who is supposed to be receiving alimony.</li>
<li>If the amount of delinquent alimony is substantial, you may be able to request that the court issue a money judgment against the spouse for the whole amount owed, including interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contacting a family law attorney will help you to file legal actions to enforce the payment of alimony and to make sure you receive the spousal support owed to you.

<p>For many, the decision to get divorced is not made lightly. Therefore, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to say they&rsquo;re getting divorced, and then decide to stay together. This is also very true for many celebrity couples. While many celebs divorce, many often decide to divorce and then change their minds.</p>
<h2 id="when-celebs-call-off-divorce">When Celebs Call Off Divorce</h2>
<p>From Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones to Brian Austin Green and Megan Fox, many celebrity couples decide that divorce is not for them. Ozzy Osbourne and Sharon also decided to stay together after publicly announcing a split. So what happens when a couple decides that marriage is not for them? Or if divorce is not for them?</p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>While it may seem that calling off a divorce is a rarity, it&rsquo;s something that happens quite often. For couples thinking about divorce, who are still un-sure, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there are other options to consider. There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>

<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge eithis. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children togethis, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce. In fact, there are various forms of divorce available (of course, you will need to ensure your state laws regarding these types of divorce), including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce.  <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involved a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations, and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce. Regardless of if you want a divorce, want a legal separation, need an annulment, or decide to cancel a divorce like the Dempsey&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s always advised that you work with a divorce attorney.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court.

<p>According to a recent Pew Research Center analysis gray <a href="https://bestdivorcelawyer.co/">divorces</a>, those that take place in marriages where people are over the age of 50, have doubled since 1990. And another recent study by The Institute for Family Studies, reveals people over the age of 55 are cheating on their spouses much more often than those under 55. Could there be a link?</p>
<h2 id="is-cheating-responsible-for-gray-divorce">Is Cheating Responsible for Gray Divorce?</h2>
<p>Gray <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> is when a couple decides, after a long marriage of a decade or more, that they want to end their marriage. According to the data recently released from the Pew Research Center, divorce rates among adults older than 50 have doubled since 1990 while divorce rates for those younger than 40 have declined. But why do couples split after 20+ years of marriage? Is there a big event that happens? Or do smaller things lead up to it? Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the reasons. In a study done by The Institute for Family Studies, twenty percent of married Americans that were surveyed and over the age of 55 admitted to having extra-marital sex. Meanwhile, 14 percent of those surveyed that were under the age of 55 admitted to extra-marital sex. “Even as overall divorce rates have fallen in recent decades, there has been a startling surge in ‘grey divorce’ among the middle-aged. Part of that story seems to be a corresponding increase in mid-life adultery, which seems to be both the cause and the consequence of a failing marriage. “The declining rates of extra-marital sex among younger Americans seemingly portends a future of monogamous marriage. But the seeds sown by the sexual revolution continue to bear unanticipated fruit among older Americans.”</p>
<h2 id="other-reasons">Other Reasons</h2>
<h4 id="peoplegrow-apart">People Grow Apart</h4>
<p>Just as with any divorce, and any relationship for that matter, there is always a chance for two people to just grow apart and become interested in other things. Or little things build up. According to author of <em>Wired for Love</em> Stan Tatkin says, “It’s like an unbreakable plate you drop repeatedly. The relationship develops microcracks inside the structure you can’t see. Then it finally reaches a critical mass and shatters.” There can be an undercurrent of dissatisfaction that evolves for many reasons. According to Tatkin, “Often one person — usually the woman — feels she’s given up too much. She may have put aside her career as she raised the children. She feels the wear and tear of the relationship because it wasn’t collaborative.”</p>
<h3 id="age-is-a-factor">Age is a Factor</h3>
<p>Other times age is a factor. A  big age difference that was not an issue at the beginning of a relationship may become a problem later in life, Tatkin says. Or people may hit middle-age and crave a reboot. As Tatkin explains, as people age they go through physiological and biological “brain upgrades.” This can happen at 15 and can happen at 40. It&rsquo;s the whole reasoning behind a mid-life crisis. “Every time you experience one [of these brain upgrades] you want to go back [in time],” he says.</p>
<h4 id="couples-are-bored">Couples are Bored</h4>
<p>Steve Siebold, a psychological performance and mental toughness coach and author of 177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class, believes that boredom can play a part in gray divorce.  “Being around the same person 24/7, depending on the relationship, can lead to boredom,” he says. Additionally, people often just stop trying and become complacent. “You work hard, play hard and take care of business, but you’ve stopped being the attentive, attractive spouse. You’ve allowed yourself to become complacent.”</p>
<h4 id="differences-in-spending-habits">Differences in Spending Habits</h4>
<p>Money and finances are always a sticking point for married couples. Financial problems can be even greater when two spouses have different spending habits - like one is a saver and the other is a spender. According to Siebold, “The kids’ activities, expenses and college funds eat the family’s discretionary cash and you’re deep in debt.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="sexual-incompatibility">Sexual Incompatibility</h3>
<p>Any sexual incompatibility that might have existed throughout the time of the relationship can become more pronounced, says Jessica O’Reilly, author of <em>The New Sex Bible</em>.  “Hormonal changes that arise with age can cause significant shifts in sex drive. And though every couple of every age experiences differentials in desire, these can become more pronounced with age.” Whatever your reason is for divorcing, you&rsquo;ll want to know what the process is.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children, as is quite common among gray divorces. Knowing this, if you are divorcing after a long marriage, chances are there will be a lot to figure out when it comes to dividing marital property and assets. Below is an overview of the divorce process. As is always advised, but especially advised for couples that will need to figure out a lot aspects of their marriage, you&rsquo;ll want to work with <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">a divorce attorney</a> that can advise you on your divorce.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-divorce-process">Starting the Divorce Process</h2>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo; Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. It should be noted that Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together, and have few assets and debts. This is most likely not the best option for those going through a gray divorce. Most likely, you will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-note-on-property-division">A quick note on property division:</h3>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/">Property division</a> is a big aspect of the agreement process of divorce, and one that will most likely affect those who are involved in a gray divorce. Major assets include: homes, furniture, artwork, jewelry, and appliances. Property is decided according to your state&rsquo;s specific laws. This has the potential to be very litigious during a divorce, especially a divorce that follows many years of marriage. <strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inherited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highis wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided.

<p>The long history of child custody and the awarding of it goes back to Colonial times and the early Republic between 1630 and 1830. The way children are viewed and the relationships between husbands and wives have evolved, parallels this history.</p>
<h2 id="shifting-patterns-of-child-custody-overview">Shifting Patterns of Child Custody Overview</h2>
<p>, to the mothis having more of a reason and stake in assuming custody of the child. The &ldquo;best interest of the child&rdquo; focused on which parent would be best at nurturing. In the normal tradition of men and women, this meant the mothis. During the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, women took on more of an equal economic role, resulting in the shift of custody from one parent over the othis to both parents, or joint or shared child custody, as long as it&rsquo;s in &ldquo;the best interest of the child.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="child-custody-and-divorce">Child Custody and Divorce</h3>
<p>. Thisefore, in the rare case of a divorce, the fathis retained his legal right to control and custody of any children.</p>
<h3 id="divorce-using-the-legislature">Divorce Using the Legislature</h3>
<p>For states following the English tradition, divorce was only able to be through a private bill submitted in the legislature. In New England the divorce laws became more liberal as marriage became under civil court jurisdiction. States could then grant divorce if eithis the husband or wife could prove the othis neglected any fundamental duty. Common reasons for divorce included desertion, adultery, and an absence for a period of time the government determined.</p>
<h3 id="common-states-for-divorce">Common States for Divorce</h3>
<p>In Massachusetts and Connecticut divorce was more common, but children weren&rsquo;t considered as part of these divorces. Divorce records didn&rsquo;t include any statements mentioning the &ldquo;best interests of the children&rdquo;, nor any concerns for their welfare, involving these divorces.</p>
<h3 id="no-child-custody-disputes">No Child Custody Disputes</h3>
<p>Perhaps disputes over child custody prior to the nineteenth century was due to the fact that fathiss were generally entitled to control and custody, so mothiss believed they didn&rsquo;t have a chance to get custody of their children. Because they felt they didn&rsquo;t have a chance to get custody, this prevented many women from getting a divorce, and may even encouraged them to remain in loveless marriages to remain a part of their children&rsquo;s lives. Anothis reason may have been child custody disputes whise the mothis received custody rights because they were deserted by their husbands. Whise adultery is involved, mothiss frequently were left to take care of the family by themselves. It was common for husbands to &ldquo;go west&rdquo; seeking new opportunities, abandoning and forgetting to send for their wives and children.</p>
<h3 id="child-custody-in-the-nineteenth-century">Child Custody in the Nineteenth Century</h3>
<p>The colonial viewpoint of children as &ldquo;labor&rdquo; evolved into the nineteenth century romantic notion that children had their own interests. This perception shift for children as non-&ldquo;labor&rdquo; was complex. A large part of this shift in perception of children was the emergence in the culture of the &ldquo;middle-class&rdquo; that put more value on the educational and emotional investment over the economic value of a child. The women&rsquo;s movement was also gaining momentum, which picked up a woman&rsquo;s child custody rights as part of their platforms during this period.</p>
<h3 id="child-custody-disputes-increased-in-the-nineteenth-century">Child Custody Disputes Increased in the Nineteenth Century</h3>
<p>Two things are likely the cause of child custody disputes increases in the nineteenth century. One was the divorce increase, and the othis involved the uncertainly of laws governing child custody. In most states divorces became easier to get, and people took advantage of this. Between 1867 and 1871 approximately 53,000 divorces were granted. Between 1887 and 1891 this number almost tripled. Nationally thise were 157,324 divorces granted during this period. In 40% of these divorces children were involved, with anothis 20-40% not reporting whethis children were involved or whethis thise was an absence of children.</p>
<h3 id="judges-torn-between-new-and-old-tradition">Judges Torn Between New and Old Tradition</h3>
<p>Judges dealing with divorce used to be torn between ruling in the old tradition, favoring the fathis, or the new tradition, taking &ldquo;the best interest of the child&rdquo; into consideration. The result of this was the idea that the &ldquo;best interest of the child&rdquo; should be to remain with the mothis. This was particularly the case when the mothis had very young children. The courts tended to favor giving custody of you children to the mothis, known as &ldquo;the tender years doctrine.&rdquo; The precedent was the People ex rel. Sinclair v. Sinclair case, which stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature has devolved upon the mothis the nurture and care of infants during their tender years, and in that period such care, for all practical purposes, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, is almost exclusively committed to his. At such periods of life courts do not hesitate to award the care and custody of young infants to the wife as against the paramount right of the husband whise the wife has shown hisself to be a proper person and is able to fully discharge his duty toward the child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless the mothis is deemed unfit, this has become the standard practice for custody of &ldquo;tender years&rdquo; children. The two exceptions to this practice of giving custody to the mothis is if the mothis is accused of adultery or leaving his husband without just cause. The &ldquo;just cause&rdquo; is determined by the judge.</p>
<h3 id="the-progressive-era-of-child-custody">The Progressive Era of Child Custody</h3>
<p>The year usually marked as the beginning of the reform-minded Progressive Era is 1890. During that year 33,461 divorces were granted in the United States. In 1920 granted divorces surged to 167,105, which is usually considered the end of this reform era. The large shift in the stigma of divorce is associated with this large shift. Divorce, once rare, is now commonplace, as is child custody disputes. The idea of child support and the obligation of the fathis to support his children without having custody is a standard practice today. Courts are gradually turning away from the traditional double standard of &ldquo;moral fitness&rdquo; and the idea of a mothis&rsquo;s sexual misconduct branding his as unfit, while a fathis&rsquo;s sexual misconduct is forgiven.</p>
<h3 id="keezers-new-rule-of-divorce-and-child-custody">Keezer&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Rule&rdquo; of Divorce and Child Custody</h3>
<p>A &ldquo;new rule&rdquo; that is emerging is Keezer&rsquo;s Law of Marriage and Divorce, the 1920&rsquo;s leading family law treatise. It states, &ldquo;Whise the children are of tender years, othis things being equal, the mothis is preferred as their custodian, and this more especially in the case of female children, and this though she may have been guilty of delinquencies in the past but thise is no evidence that she was delinquent at the time of determining the matter by the court.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="new-movement-in-child-custody-in-late-twentieth-and-early-21st-centuries">New Movement in Child Custody in Late Twentieth and Early 21st Centuries</h3>
<p>The term &ldquo;child custody&rdquo; permeated society conversation toward the last third of the twentieth century. Few, if any, households remained untouched whise child custody issues were concerned, most of which was because of the increasing divorce rate. And divorce rates increased, so did the rules and laws determining child custody. In 1973 a New York court stated, &ldquo;The simple fact of being a mothis does not, by itself, indicate a capacity or willingness to render a quality of care different from that which the fathis can provide.&rdquo; The idea that a child&rsquo;s best interest during its &ldquo;tender years&rdquo; was served by giving the mothis custody was abolished between 1960 and 2000 in almost all 50 states.</p>
<h3 id="new-ways-to-think-about-child-custody">New Ways to Think About Child Custody</h3>
<p>With old notions set aside, judges and state legislators are turning to social science to decide the difficult decisions that come before them in child custody disputes. Some popular psychological theories include that one parent should be the primary caregiver for a child, and that parent should be the mothis. The othis theory is that both parents should share custody and be involved with the development of the child. Neithis theory favors the mothis having custody or the &ldquo;tender years&rdquo; idea.</p>
<h3 id="bringing-in-expert">Bringing in Expert</h3>
<p>Mental health and developmental experts and professional increasing being used in child custody cases to help determine which parent should have custody, or whethis joint custody is the best option. Today courts will frequently request a psychological evaluation containing a wide range of information on both parents, the children, psychodynamic factors, and economic and social data to help determine the best child custody arrangement.</p>
<h3 id="effect-of-divorce-on-children">Effect of Divorce on Children</h3>
<p>A divorce&rsquo;s effect on children is still up for debate. No general consensus has been decided about whethis divorce has a lifelong negative impact on how children of divorce will fare in the future. Because of this point, it makes sense that the idea of what the &ldquo;best interests of a child&rdquo; consists of is still open for dispute.

<p>Though January is often declared as &ldquo;Divorce Month,&rdquo; a new study reveals that the most common months for divorce filings are March and August.</p>
<h2 id="march-and-august-deemed-divorce-months">March and August Deemed &ldquo;Divorce Months&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Study results recently released by the University of Washington Researchers might prove that March and August are the new &ldquo;Divorce Months.&rdquo; Prior to the study, January was often the &ldquo;hot month&rdquo; for divorce. Interestingly, researchers Julie Brines and Brian Serafini were actually looking for a different kind of divorce trend when they started their research - whether or not the recession had affected American marriages and subsequent divorce.  But while looking looked at filings from counties in Washington state from 2001 through 2015, they found some different peaks in numbers - divorce filings spiking in the months of March and August. According to Brines and Serafini, this so-called &ldquo;domestic ritual&rdquo; might be attributed to couples not wanting to ruin the holidays with a divorce - and thus waiting til March to file. Additionally, the August divorces might be attributed to the fact that parents attempt a summer trip as a last-ditch effort to make things &ldquo;right.&rdquo; “People tend to face the holidays with rising expectations, despite what disappointments they might have had in years past,” said Brines. “They represent periods in the year when there’s the anticipation or the opportunity for a new beginning, a new start, something different, a transition into a new period of life. It’s like an optimism cycle, in a sense.” Regardless of your reason for ending your marriage, know that there is another option to divorce available: legal separation.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing There&rsquo;s a lot of &ldquo;new territory&rdquo; when it comes to legal separation and how to act. Whether the legal separation ends in reconciliation or <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>, there are some rules of engagement you should follow. Here are some tips to consider.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="legal-separation-agreement">Legal Separation Agreement</h2>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<h3 id="contained-in-the-legal-separation-agreement">Contained in the Legal Separation Agreement</h3>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-not-divorce">Legal Separation Not Divorce</h3>
<p>Remember that a legal separation is not a divorce. While it gives a couple time and space to decide what the next step is, it is not the official end of a marriage. If you wish to return your legal status to &ldquo;single&rdquo; you will need to file for a legal <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>. Here&rsquo;s a little information on what you should expect out of the divorce process.</p>
<h2 id="divorce">Divorce</h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution. Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different, and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-divorce">Steps for Divorce</h2>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce in the new year, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure.

<p>A recently released study from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh suggests a divorce in which the parents separate and then do not communicate can raise a child&rsquo;s risk of getting more colds when they are in adulthood.</p>
<h2 id="can-divorce-harm-your-childs-immune-system">Can Divorce Harm Your Child&rsquo;s Immune System?</h2>
<p>The study found children of parents that separated and did not speak to each other afterward could be at an increased risk for developing colds as adults. &ldquo;Early life stressful experiences do something to our physiology and inflammatory processes that increase risk for poorer health and chronic illness,&rdquo; explained researcher Michael Murphy. The study of more than 200 healthy adults exposed adults whose parents had lived apart and were not on good communicating terms and adults whose parents who remained together or separated but remained in communication to the common cold virus. Adults whose parents were in communication were three times more likely to develop the cold than participants whose parents had stayed together or remained in communication. The study only found an association - not a cause-and-effect link. &ldquo;Our results target the immune system as an important carrier of the long-term negative impact of early family conflict,&rdquo; said Sheldon Cohen, a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon. &ldquo;They also suggest that all divorces are not equal,&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;This work is a step forward in our understanding of how family stress during childhood may influence a child&rsquo;s susceptibility to disease 20-40 years later,&rdquo; said Murphy said.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-co-parenting-relationship">Creating a Co-Parenting Relationship</h2>
<p>Becoming a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">co-parent</a> is difficult, so how can you effectively do it? When people decide to divorce, very often it&rsquo;s their children that take the separation the hardest. When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is totally new and different from what you might expect, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. Now that you&rsquo;re divorced and completely ended your relationship, with all legal aspects neatly tied up, you can continue on with your new single life and never have to deal with your ex again! That is unless you have children. If you do, then you need to put the breaks on a bit. If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be placed in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-is-to-set-boundaries">Step Two is to Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Here are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side when scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, thise are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, thise are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are togethis try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachis conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each othis and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>One of the hardest parts of the divorce process is, undoubtedly, figuring out <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">child custody arrangements</a>. When it comes down to making decisions, the court will always rule in the best interests of a child, even when those best wishes go against a parent&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<h2 id="child-custody---then-and-now">Child Custody - Then and Now</h2>
<p>Over the years, &ldquo;child custody&rdquo; has had a number of meanings. In colonial times children were treated as economic factors - the more children you had, the more work could be done around the household. The view of children as economic resources has obviously changed in recent times. As a result, there are different laws in place governing child custody.  For example, in California, the law provides judges with certain guidelines when it comes to child custody decisions. While a court will often favor joint custody, where both parents play a role in child-rearing, there are exceptions where shared parenting might not be possible. Therefore, there is an order of preference in place when it comes to child custody arrangements, as is demonstrated below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joint custody</li>
<li>Sole custody. In this instance, a judge will decide on the custodial parent.</li>
<li>Non-parent custody. In this instance, a judge may rule it is best for a child to live with someone other than a parent.</li>
<li>Suitable Persons</li>
</ul>
<p>A judge will weigh all information provided regarding the parents and the child before awarding custody. Judges are also given broad discretion in cases, so that the child&rsquo;s best interests are met. <strong>Additional Factors</strong> The California Family Code outlines what a judge will consider when deciding on disputes. These various factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Child’s health and welfare</li>
<li>Physical abuse</li>
<li>History of violent crimes</li>
<li>Parental drug or alcohol abuse</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="then">Then</h2>
<p>The long history of custody and the awarding of it goes back to Colonial times and the early Republic between 1630 and 1830. The way children are viewed and the relationships between husbands and wives have evolved, parallels this history. Back in colonial and early republic times, children were treated as economic assets based on the amount of labor they were able to do. In the nineteenth century, this changed and the emphasis was focused more on the child&rsquo;s nurturing and education. As this viewpoint became the norm, the legal aspect of &ldquo;the best interest of the child&rdquo; was more of a consideration. As this view became more common, there was a shift away from the father always having control of the children (due to the fact children were considered labor assets), to the mother having more of a reason and stake in assuming custody of the child. The &ldquo;best interest of the child&rdquo; focused on which parent would be best at nurturing. In the normal tradition of men and women, this meant the mother. During the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, women took on more of an equal economic role, resulting in the shift of custody from one parent over the other to both parents, or joint or shared child custody, as long as it&rsquo;s in &ldquo;the best interest of the child.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="custody-and-divorce">Custody and Divorce</h3>
<p>While custody is normally thought about as a result of divorce, this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Divorce in the latter half of the twentieth century is more acceptable, as well as the idea that custody and divorce go hand-in-hand. Divorce wasn&rsquo;t common in early America, and until 1753 English law mandated that marriages couldn&rsquo;t be destroyed. In spite of this, the idea of child custody still existed. Common reasons for this issue included the inability or incompetence of being able to care for the child, the death of one or both parents, and a birth of an illegitimate child. When these issues of custody arose, two major areas of consideration became the child&rsquo;s labor value and the ability or lack thereof for the parents to properly support their child. In a marriage, the father had complete control and custody of the children because under common law women were considered femmes couvertes (meaning &ldquo;covered women&rdquo;). Therefore, in the rare case of a divorce, the father retained his legal right to control and custody of any children.</p>
<h3 id="divorce-using-the-legislature">Divorce Using the Legislature</h3>
<p>For states following the English tradition, divorce was only able to be through a private bill submitted in the legislature. In New England the divorce laws became more liberal as marriage became under civil court jurisdiction. States could then grant divorce if either the husband or wife could prove the other neglected any fundamental duty. Common reasons for divorce included desertion, adultery, and an absence for a period of time the government determine</p>
<h3 id="child-custody-in-the-nineteenth-century">Child Custody in the Nineteenth Century</h3>
<p>The colonial viewpoint of children as &ldquo;labor&rdquo; evolved into the nineteenth century romantic notion that children had their own interests. This perception shift for children as non-&ldquo;labor&rdquo; was complex. A large part of this shift in perception of children was the emergence in the culture of the &ldquo;middle-class&rdquo; that put more value on the educational and emotional investment over the economic value of a child. The women&rsquo;s movement was also gaining momentum, which picked up a woman&rsquo;s custody rights as part of their platforms during this period.</p>
<h3 id="judges-torn-between-new-and-old-tradition">Judges Torn Between New and Old Tradition</h3>
<p>Judges dealing with divorce used to be torn between ruling in the old tradition, favoring the father, or the new tradition, taking &ldquo;the best interest of the child&rdquo; into consideration. The result of this was the idea that the &ldquo;best interest of the child&rdquo; should be to remain with the mother. This was particularly the case when the mother had very young children. The courts tended to favor giving custody of you children to the mother, known as &ldquo;the tender years doctrine.&rdquo; The precedent was the People ex rel. Sinclair v. Sinclair case, which stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature has devolved upon the mother the nurture and care of infants during their tender years, and in that period such care, for all practical purposes, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, is almost exclusively committed to his. At such periods of life courts do not hesitate to award the care and custody of young infants to the wife as against the paramount right of the husband where the wife has shown herself to be a proper person and is able to fully discharge his duty toward the child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless the mother is deemed unfit, this has become the standard practice for custody of &ldquo;tender years&rdquo; children. The two exceptions to this practice of giving custody to the mother is if the mother is accused of adultery or leaving his husband without just cause. The &ldquo;just cause&rdquo; is determined by the judge.</p>
<h3 id="the-progressive-era-of-custody">The Progressive Era of Custody</h3>
<p>The year usually marked as the beginning of the reform-minded Progressive Era is 1890. During that year 33,461 divorces were granted in the United States. In 1920 granted divorces surged to 167,105, which is usually considered the end of this reform era. The large shift in the stigma of divorce is associated with this large shift. Divorce, once rare, is now commonplace, as is child custody disputes. The idea of child support and the obligation of the father to support his children without having custody is a standard practice today. Courts are gradually turning away from the traditional double standard of &ldquo;moral fitness&rdquo; and the idea of a mother&rsquo;s sexual misconduct branding his as unfit, while a father&rsquo;s sexual misconduct is forgiven.</p>
<h3 id="new-movement-in-custody-in-late-twentieth-and-early-21st-centuries">New Movement in Custody in Late Twentieth and Early 21st Centuries</h3>
<p>The term &ldquo;child custody&rdquo; permeated society conversation toward the last third of the twentieth century. Few, if any, households remained untouched where custody issues were concerned, most of which was because of the increasing divorce rate. And divorce rates increased, so did the rules and laws determining custody. In 1973 a New York court stated, &ldquo;The simple fact of being a mother does not, by itself, indicate a capacity or willingness to render a quality of care different from that which the father can provide.&rdquo; The idea that a child&rsquo;s best interest during its &ldquo;tender years&rdquo; was served by giving the mother custody was abolished between 1960 and 2000 in almost all 50 states.</p>
<h3 id="new-ways-to-think-about-custody">New Ways to Think About Custody</h3>
<p>With old notions set aside, judges and state legislators are turning to social science to decide the difficult decisions that come before them in custody disputes. Some popular psychological theories include that one parent should be the primary caregiver for a child, and that parent should be the mother. The other theory is that both parents should share custody and be involved with the development of the child. Neither theory favors the mother having custody or the &ldquo;tender years&rdquo; idea.</p>
<h3 id="bringing-in-expert">Bringing in Expert</h3>
<p>Mental health and developmental experts and professional increasing being used in custody cases to help determine which parent should have custody, or whether joint custody is the best option. Today courts will frequently request a psychological evaluation containing a wide range of information on both parents, the children, psychodynamic factors, and economic and social data to help determine the best custody arrangement.</p>
<h3 id="effect-of-divorce-on-children">Effect of Divorce on Children</h3>
<p>A divorce&rsquo;s effect on children is still up for debate. No general consensus has been decided about whethis divorce has a lifelong negative impact on how children of divorce will fare in the future. Because of this point, it makes sense that the idea of what the &ldquo;best interests of a child&rdquo; consists of is still open for dispute.

<p>Rapper 50 Cent is looking forward to the day until he can stop paying child support.</p>
<h2 id="50-cents-done-with-child-support">50 Cent&rsquo;s Done With Child Support</h2>
<p>The rapper, real name Curtis Jackson, recently posted a countdown on his Instagram to the day when his child support is up for his eldest son Marquise Jackson. The post has since been deleted. &ldquo;Man real life is gonna start Sooner then you think. Sad part is I wish you well, good. #Shanquagetsajob,&rdquo; Jackson posted in reference to his ex and Marquise&rsquo;s mother, Shaniqua Tompkins. Jackson, 18, quickly fired back, writing &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;ll make you proud! Just don&rsquo;t forget to tell me happy birthday that day cause u missed a few.&rdquo; The back-and-forth argument continued with Marquise posting an image of himself clapping, with the caption: &ldquo;Around of applause for those who come for you when you don&rsquo;t send for them.&rdquo;   Apparently, 50 Cent had made attempts to mend the relationship with his son last year, but it appears that might not have worked out.</p>
<h2 id="child-support">Child Support</h2>
<p>, and you receive a petition for child support, you respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-a-child-support-petition">Receiving a Child Support Petition</h2>
<p>Once you receive a child support petition, you must follow the instructions on that petition. This often means you will need to appear in court on a specific date. During the court hearing, a judge will examine your income, the other parent&rsquo;s income, how much time the child spends with each parent, as well as any special circumstances regarding day care or medical expenses, and then determine how much you will pay in child support.</p>
<h2 id="child-support-hearing">Child Support Hearing</h2>
<p>To prepare for the child support hearing, you need to put together and bring the following to court: evidence of your income and any other court requested documents. If you do not believe you are the father of the child, and you have not been legally stated as the father, you are able to request a paternity test. If this request is accepted, the child will need to submit to the test before you are required to make child support payments.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-appear-or-pay">Failure to Appear or Pay</h3>
<p>If you do not appear at the child support hearing or do not make child support payments as ordered by the court, then the court can take measures to collect the unpaid payments. This might mean garnishing your wages, suspension of your driver&rsquo;s license, or over legal actions, such as jail time and fines.</p>
<h2 id="tomlinson-and-jungwirth-co-parenting">Tomlinson and Jungwirth Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>In February Tomlinson purchased a home in Calabasas for Jungwirth and his son. He appears to be renting a $49,000 a month home in the Hollywood Hills to be close to his son so that he can be a more available to co-parent. Though it seems that Tomlinson and Jungwirth are on good terms, co-parenting can be very difficult - especially if you are not fond of the person you are expected to co-parent with. This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Here are some steps you can follow: <strong>Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</strong> In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse. <strong>Step Two is to Set Boundaries</strong> The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Here are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with GQ, Brad Pitt opened up about his divorce from Angelina Jolie and the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> battle that has followed. He also revealed that he&rsquo;s in therapy and has stopped drinking and that much of the drama was &ldquo;self-inflicted.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="brad-pitt-talks-about-divorce-and-children-in-recent-interview">Brad Pitt Talks About Divorce and Children in Recent Interview</h2>
<p>As Pitt told GQ about his divorce, “I was boozing too much. It’s just become a problem. And I’m really happy it’s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I’ve got my feelings in my fingertips again.” Pitt admitted he&rsquo;s concerned about how the media attention surrounding his custody dispute has affected his kids, saying, “I worry about it more for my kids, being subjected to it, and their friends getting ideas from it. And of course, it’s not done with any kind of delicacy or insight—it’s done to sell. And so you know the most sensational sells, and that’s what they’ll be subjected to, and that pains me.” Pitt&rsquo;s divorce was also a wake-up call for him in terms of being there for his children. “It’s hit me smack in the face with our divorce: I gotta be more. I gotta be more for them. I have to show them. And I haven’t been great at it,” he said.</p>
<h2 id="child-custody">Child Custody</h2>
<p>In California, the law provides judges with certain guidelines when it comes to child custody decisions. While a court will often favor joint custody, where both parents play a role in child-rearing, there are exceptions where shared parenting might not be possible. Therefore, there is an order of preference in place when it comes to child custody arrangements, as is demonstrated below:</p>

<p>A judge will weigh all information provided regarding the parents and the child before awarding custody. Judges are also given broad discretion in cases so that the child&rsquo;s best interests are met. <strong>Additional Factors</strong> The California Family Code outlines what a judge will consider when deciding on child custody disputes. These various factors include:</p>

<li>Physical abuse</li>
<li>History of violent crimes</li>
<li>Parental drug or alcohol abuse</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-child-custody-case">Your Child Custody Case</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody</a> cases can get combative, as has been seen during the Jolie and Pitt custody battle. Typically, both parents want equal time with their children. But all too often a parent will try to argue that the other parent isn&rsquo;t fit to raise a child. Here are some things you can do to protect yourself when entering a litigious child custody case.</p>
<h2 id="record-everything">Record Everything</h2>
<p>When resolving <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the other parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the other parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the child or children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the other parent</li>
<li>If the other parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the other parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions. Being able to remove any emotions you have about the other parent will help you stay focused on creating an unbiased record. State the facts and try to keep the emotions out of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>
<p>Using a spiral notebook, Excel document, or any other form that will help you keep track of every interaction, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Times of calls or visits</li>
<li>Topics discussed (either between you or the other spouse or between the other spouse and your child or children). This does not have to mean an invasion of privacy, but if you&rsquo;re able to get a gauge of what was discussed between your child or children and the other parent it only builds a stronger case</li>
<li>Duration of phone call or visit</li>
<li>Was the interaction spontaneous or part of a pre-arranged visitation schedule?</li>
<li>How the child or children felt prior to the visit or call, as well as after</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionaltips"> <strong>Additional Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent in your record keeping. If that means setting a daily time to record anything that has happened, then do so. Waiting days or weeks to record an interaction will make it difficult for you to remember specifics.</li>
<li>Be neutral! Try to not let emotion get ahold of you.</li>
<li>Research your state laws regarding auto recordings and telephone calls. In some jurisdictions, recording conversations is illegal.</li>
<li>Work with a lawyer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision-making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living together, or even if they never lived together.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>There are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>

<p>53-year-old Zvia Gordestky, an Israeli Jewish woman has been on a hunger strike since last week in an attempt to finally be granted a divorce from her husband.</p>
<h2 id="zvia-gordestky-turns-to-hunger-strike-for-divorce">Zvia Gordestky Turns to Hunger Strike for Divorce</h2>
<p>Gordestky is on hunger strike outside of Israel’s parliament building because, according to Jewish law, both husband and wife must agree to a divorce. Her husband refused to divorce her 16 years ago, a decision which landed him in jail. After 16 years, the couple is still married and Gordestky has had to turn to extreme measures. Gordetsky has been protesting outside of Israel’s parliament building since last Wednesday, May 3, 2017. “I need a solution,” she said. “I’ve waited 17 years, that’s long enough.”   Recently, Israeli lawmakers proposed a bill that would provide relief to so-called &ldquo;chained women&rdquo; such as Gordetsky who are unable to leave their marriages because their husbands refuse to agree to divorce. A discussion on the proposed bill has been postponed for three months, causing women such as Gordetsky to lose hope. The bill would allow the state to annul marriages for women who have attempted to divorce their husbands for over a year, and is based on a Jewish law that requires a financial payment for marriage. Typically that payment is in the form of a wedding ring. Under the proposed bill, the state would be legally able to take back the money used to buy the ring and thus void the marriage contract.   Luckily, divorce in the United States is not as difficult. Read on to learn more about the history of divorce and what your options are if you are seeking a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-divorce">The History of Divorce</h2>
<p>Within the English legal tradition, family law was governed by the officially sanctioned church. Because of that, it fell the laws and regulations made by Catholic and Anglican churches, known as Canon Law. As a result of the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 all English church authority was removed and marriage became purely a contract between two people. The U.S. First Amendment&rsquo;s Establishment Clause prevented religious authority from becoming secular law.</p>
<h2 id="common-law-marriage">Common Law Marriage</h2>
<p>In the past, children that were from a marriage that was not officially sanctioned were not allowed to inherit their parents&rsquo; property. As a result of this legality, England created the common law marriage. Common law marriage, also known by the name of sui juris, is when a couple is considered legally married without them have formally registered their marriage. Essentially, the act of the couple presenting themselves as being married acts as the evidence that they are married. The following states allow common law marriage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>District of Columbia</li>
<li>Georgia (if created before 1/1/97)</li>
<li>Idaho (if created before 1/1/96)</li>
<li>Iowa</li>
<li>Kansas</li>
<li>Montana</li>
<li>New Hampshire (for inheritance purposes only)</li>
<li>Ohio (if created before 10/10/91)</li>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>Pennsylvania (if created before 1/1/05)</li>
<li>Rhode Island</li>
<li>South Carolina</li>
<li>Texas</li>
<li>Utah</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no common law divorce which can often lead to problems regarding child custody, financial standing, etc&hellip; when a common law couple seeks to end their marriage. Annulment, separation, or divorce cannot happen unless those is a lawful marriage or legally recognized civil union.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>An annulment dissolves a marriage just as a divorce does. But an annulment essentially states that thise never was a valid marriage. Just as thise are grounds for divorce, thise are also specific grounds for annulments to be granted. Each state has their own grounds for annulment, so you will want to work with a family law attorney in the state you are seeking your annulment or divorce. The following are typical statutory grounds for granting an annulment:</p>
<ul>
<li>fraud</li>
<li>duress or force</li>
<li>bigamy</li>
<li>underage during the time of the marriage</li>
<li>intoxication</li>
<li>mental incapacity</li>
<li>insanity</li>
<li>impotence</li>
<li>concealed divorce</li>
<li>too close a kinship (consanguinity)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, thise are procedures that must be followed if you are seeking an annulment. In some situations a parent or guardian may be allowed to seek an annulment for a third person. Each state has different residency requirements. You will also need to be wary of the timing of your annulment as some grounds for an annulment can be lost if too much time elapses from the date of the marriage. Children born during the course of the marriage are typically treated like children in a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation is a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a separation while still remaining legally married. This is often the best option for couples that need to meet religious objections or need health insurance to cover a seriously ill spouse. A court is able to award &ldquo;separate maintenance&rdquo; as part of a legal separation. This is the equivalent of alimony and child support. In some states, thise must be grounds for separation, such as cruel and inhuman treatment, abandonment, neglect or refusal to support, adultery by the defendant, and confinement of the defendant in prison. Reconciliation is always possible and a court order may end the separation.</p>
<h2 id="grounds-for-divorce">Grounds for Divorce</h2>
<p>, and any remaining waiting period before the divorce is final. In California this waiting time is 6 months and a day. That is how long it takes for your legal status to be changed from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to &ldquo;single.&rdquo; In a no-fault state, neithis party is &ldquo;blamed&rdquo; for the end of the marriage, and typically couples choose &ldquo;irreconcilable differences,&rdquo; meaning that they are unable to make the marriage work, and will never be able to make the marriage work.  All states have some form of no-fault divorce, using words such as &ldquo;incompatibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;insupportability,&rdquo; or &ldquo;irreconcilable differences as reasons. Roughly one third of the states have repealed their older fault-based grounds for divorce. Several states also allow marrying couples to create a &ldquo;Covenant Marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="what-is-covenant-marriage">What is Covenant Marriage?</h3>
<p>Covenant marriages require the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before obtaining a covenant marriage license the couple must receive premartial counseling from eithis a priest, minister,rabbi, clergyman of any religious sect, or a professional marriage counselor.</li>
<li>The couple must legally agree to seek marital counseling if problems develop during the marriage.</li>
<li>The couple can only seek a divorce or legal separation for limited reasons, such as: adultery, the committing a felony with a sentence of imprisonment at hard labor or death, abandonment, physical or sexual abuse, habitual intemperance (for example,alcohol or drug abuse), cruel treatment, or severe ill treatment by the othis spouse. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Often times a state will require longer amounts of time to pass between separation and divorce. The rationale for longer time periods is to encourage reconciliation between the couple. In some states, especially when it comes to cases involving child custody, a couple will need to attend mandatory mediation. The <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">mediation</a> process is confidential, can be less adversarial, and is often less expensive than standard courtroom proceedings. You cn choose this form of divorce proceedings even if it is not required by law. <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">Collaborative divorce</a> is also a possibility for parties to obtain a dissolution of marriage.</p>
<h2 id="mediation-and-collaborative-law">Mediation and Collaborative Law</h2>
<p>Mediation and collaborative law are often effective choices for couples that are able to negotiate on the aspects of their marriage, including child custody and visitation, alimony, and division of marital property. These approaches provide more of a group and team-setting whise the spouses sit down with a group of professionals including family law attorneys, financial advisers, and often thisapists and othis negotiators to come to a decision regarding the divorce agreement. These approaches can often be less litigious and yield a better outcome that satisfies both spouses&rsquo; needs. You also do not need to be in complete agreement going into mediation or collaboration. Couples that have been unable to see eye-to-eye on many things have found these approaches to be beneficial.</p>

<p>Rapper Flo Rida is facing new allegations that he owes child support for a child that he claims he did not father.</p>
<h2 id="flo-rida-dealing-with-paternity-and-child-support-case">Flo Rida Dealing with Paternity and Child Support Case</h2>
<p>Alexis Adams has filed court documents against rapper Flo Rida that allege that her son, Zohar Paxton is Flo Rida&rsquo;s. In the documents, Adams claims she had sexual encounters with Flo Rida, real name Tramar Lacel Dillard, between December 2015 and January 2016. She gave birth to her son in September 2016. He suffers from hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluid on the brain and she is struggling to pay the child&rsquo;s medical expenses. This is not the first time Flo Rida has been the subject of a paternity case. In 2014 it was revealed he fathered a child with model Natasha Georgette Williams, after claiming he was not the child&rsquo;s father. In 2013 a financial support claim was overturned after a DNA test proved he was not the father of Gloria Holloway&rsquo;s two-year-old son.</p>
<h2 id="paternity">Paternity</h2>
<p>Either parent is able to dispute <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/" title="San Diego Paternity Lawyer">paternity</a>. Generally, if paternity has not yet been established, a parent is able to ask for a paternity test in order to establish if the father is actually the child’s biological father. Under California law, the word &ldquo;paternity&rdquo; is used interchangeably with &ldquo;parentage&rdquo; and &ldquo;parental relationship.&rdquo; Laws regarding paternity are complicated. For example, if a court order has already determined someone is the fathis of the child, and he or the mothis of the child wants genetic (DNA) testing, it might be too late to do so, due to the court order. A court order might also determine someone to be the legal fathis despite the genetic test proving he is not the biological fathis.</p>
<h3 id="paternity-assumption">Paternity Assumption</h3>
<p>Establishing paternity means eithis the courts or parents of the child have determined who the fathis is. The law assumes paternity under these instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>the husband of the mothis is presumed to be the child&rsquo;s fathis when the child is born during a marriage.</li>
<li>if a man has been living with the child and the mothis in a &ldquo;family-like&rdquo; manner, the man has demonstrated he is committed to the child, and even if he is not the biological fathis, he is still presumed to be the child&rsquo;s fathis.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these two things are not the case, then paternity needs to be established.</p>
<h3 id="paternity-testing">Paternity Testing</h3>
<p>Establishing paternity is helpful when it comes to providing financial support and health insurance for the child. it&rsquo;s also important to establish paternity if thise are ever legal issues surrounding child support and child visitation. If you need to establish paternity, you should work with a family law attorney to see if you legally can, and how to go about getting the genetic (DNA) test done.

<h2 id="child-support">Child Support</h2>
<p>, and you receive a petition for child support, you respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-a-child-support-petition">Receiving a Child Support Petition</h2>
<p>Once you receive a child support petition, you must follow the instructions on that petition. This often means you will need to appear in court on a specific date. During the court hearing, a judge will examine your income, the othis parent&rsquo;s income, how much time the child spends with each parent, as well as any special circumstances regarding day care or medical expenses, and then determine how much you will pay in child support.</p>
<h2 id="child-support-hearing">Child Support Hearing</h2>
<p>To prepare for the child support hearing, you need to put togethis and bring the following to court: evidence of your income and any othis court requested documents. If you do not believe you are the fathis of the child, and you have not been legally stated as the fathis, you are able to request a paternity test. If this request is accepted, the child will need to submit to the test before you are required to make child support payments.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-appear-or-pay">Failure to Appear or Pay</h3>
<p>If you do not appear at the child support hearing, or do not make child support payments as ordered by the court, then the court can take measures to collect the unpaid payments. This might mean garnishing your wages, suspension of your driver&rsquo;s license, or over legal actions, such as jail time and fines.</p>
<h2 id="tomlinson-and-jungwirth-co-parenting">Tomlinson and Jungwirth Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>In February Tomlinson purchased a home in Calabasas for Jungwirth and his son. He appears to be renting a $49,000 a month home in the Hollywood Hills to be close to his son so that he can be a more available to co-parent. Though it seems that Tomlinson and Jungwirth are on good terms, co-parenting can be very difficult - especially if you are not fond of the person you are expected to co-parent with. This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Here are some steps you can follow: <strong>Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</strong> In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse. <strong>Step Two is to Set Boundaries</strong> The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Almost two years after originally announcing they would be <a href="https://619divorce.com/">divorcing</a>, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have filed official divorce papers.</p>
<h2 id="ben-affleck-and-jennifer-garner-officially-file-for-divorce">Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner Officially File for Divorce</h2>
<p>Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck filed divorce documents together. They are seeking joint legal as well as physical custody of their children. For now, the date of separation, as well as the division of property and spousal support are to be determined. The couple announced their plans to split in 2015, but have since then been seen together on many occasions - most often with their children. Affleck is actually still living in the family&rsquo;s guest house in Los Angeles. “For now, they are all living together. One thing they agree on — the kids will stay at the family house. Jen and Ben will focus on making things as smoothly as possible for the kids. It’s all about what’s best for them,” said a source close to the couple. </p>
<h2 id="creating-a-co-parenting-relationship">Creating a Co-Parenting Relationship</h2>
<p>Becoming a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">co-parent</a> is difficult, so how can you effectively do it? When people decide to divorce, very often it&rsquo;s their children that take the separation the hardest. When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is totally new and different from what you might expect, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. Now that you&rsquo;re divorced and completely ended your relationship, with all legal aspects neatly tied up, you can continue on with your new single life and never have to deal with your ex again! That is unless you have children. If you do, then you need to put the breaks on a bit.  If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be placed in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-is-to-set-boundaries">Step Two is to Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Here are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side when scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, thise are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, thise are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are togethis try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachis conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each othis and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Chances are, you celebrated your marriage with a wedding cake. So why not celebrate your divorce with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/">divorce</a> cake?</p>
<h2 id="a-slice-of-divorce-cake">A Slice of Divorce Cake</h2>
<p>Turns out you might just be able to have your cake and eat it too - at least when it comes to divorce. As Kim Say, owner of Adult Cakes by Kim, a Houston bakery, recently told NPR, she has an &ldquo;entire selection of divorce cakes,&rdquo; and even ha One of Say&rsquo;s customers is a lawyer who orders several of these divorce cakes each year to send to his clients. Here&rsquo;s a look at some of the most creative divorce cakes making the rounds on the internet.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>
<p>After your divorce is finalized, maybe even with a slice of cake, it&rsquo;s time to move forward. Here are some tips for self-care after divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Change Your Diet Up</li>
<li>Eat Healthy Foods</li>
<li>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule</li>
<li>Get Sunshine</li>
<li>Network of Support</li>
<li>Try to Relax</li>
<li>Practice Mindfulness</li>
<li>Consider Getting Help Using a Therapist or Mental Health Professional</li>
<li>Hold Off on Having Another Relationship</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="options-instead-of-divorce">Options Instead of Divorce</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re debating if you should get divorced or not, there are additional options for you to consider.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-and-annulment">Legal Separation and Annulment</h3>
<p>You might not need to file for divorce. There are two other options: legal separation or <em>annulment</em> (also called a <em>nullity</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal separation</strong>. This is a a legal process, granted in the form of a court order, by which a married couple can remain legally married while not living togethis. Some couples use this as a formal break, during which they have some time to decide if they would like to continue the marriage. Thise are often religious, insurance, tax, or othis reasons for wanting a legal separation instead of a formal dissolution. With a legal separation you and your spouse will remain married, but the court (or you) can divide your property and issue orders relating to child custody, visitation, child support and spousal support, and, if necessary, a restraining order.</li>
<li><strong>Annulment</strong>. Being granted an annulment makes it as if your marriage never existed. Thise are specific requirements you will need to meet to have your marriage annulled. These include being a minor without the consent of your parents or guardian during the time of the marriage, or if certain types of fraud or deceit were involved. An annulment requires you appear in court.</li>
</ul>
<p>The residency requirements for these are less harsh than standard divorces. Eithis of these can be obtained without having lived in California for six months or the county you are filing in for three months prior to filing, as is required for a standard divorce.</p>
<h3 id="summary-dissolution">Summary Dissolution</h3>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">In California</a> you are able to receive a simplified dissolution of marriage if you meet certain requirements. This is called a _summary dissolutio_n. This process requires less paperwork and you will not have to appear in court. You are eligible for a summary dissolution if you and your spouse have agreed in writing to a division of your assets and debts and if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been married for five years or less.</li>
<li>You have no children from the relationship.</li>
<li>Neithis of you own a home or othis real estate.</li>
<li>The value of all community property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>The value of eithis party&rsquo;s separate property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>Your combined debt does not exceed $4,000, except for auto loans.</li>
<li>Both of you waive spousal support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both spouses agree to these terms, you can be granted a summary dissolution. This process can be as easy as filling out a form and turning it in to your local clerk&rsquo;s office. Still, you might want to have a family law attorney review the forms before you file them.</p>
<h3 id="amount-of-time">Amount of Time</h3>
<p>In California, the mandatory waiting period required is 6 months. No couple, regardless of how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; their divorce is can be divorced faster than 6 months. This is the time it takes for the state to change your status from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to single&quot;.  You will be able to get all your paperwork turned in to the court and your divorce judgment approved, but the divorce itself will not be final until at least 6 months after the initial petition. In some cases, those that require a lot of things to be required, a divorce can take years. This is based on how much you decided to disagree and agree on. </p>

<p>Former Lone Star Funds banker Randy Work has been ordered to pay his ex-wife a share of his multi-million dollar &ldquo;genius&rdquo; fortune.</p>
<h2 id="genius-will-have-to-pay-multi-millions-in-divorce-court">&ldquo;Genius&rdquo; Will Have to Pay Multi-Millions in Divorce Court</h2>
<p>During Randy Work&rsquo;s 2015 divorce battle, the American banker claimed that he was a financial &ldquo;genius&rdquo; that had made an “exceptional contribution” to his marriage, and thus should be able to receive more than the 50-50 split of assets. The judge presiding over that 2015 case rejected that bid as well as Work&rsquo;s claim that he is a &ldquo;genius.&rdquo; “The word ‘genius’ tends to be over-used and is properly reserved for Leonardo Da Vinci, Mozart, Einstein, and others like them,” Justice Edward Holman said following the ruling Work decided to appeal Holman&rsquo;s 2015 ruling. But in a recent decision, a the three-judge panel rejected Work&rsquo;s appeal against Holman&rsquo;s ruling. “In our view, the husband has failed to demonstrate that Holman J’s decision was wrong,” the appeal judges said. It has been reported that Work’s divorce battle was worth $225 million.</p>
<h2 id="the-end-of-amarriage-but-not-financial-freedom">The End of a Marriage, But Not Financial Freedom</h2>
<p>When you decide to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">end your marriage</a>, it can feel like the end of your financial freedom. How will you handle child support payments or even manage to get food on the table now that you are down to one source of income? It can feel impossible. But just as divorce does not mean the end of your life, it also does not mean the end of your financial freedom.  There is nothing easy about ending a marriage. You&rsquo;re going to feel out of place for a while. Everything is new. Chances are you&rsquo;ve had to rearrange your schedule to now pick up the kids from their dad&rsquo;s house every othis weekend. It might mean you&rsquo;re not spending Christmas with your parents so that the children can spend Hanukkah with their mom&rsquo;s family. You might need to set up an automatic child support and spousal support payment to your ex husband for every third week of the month. Or maybe you need to call your now ex wife to make sure that she drops off the soccer cleats at the school that your son left at his house over the weekend. Regardless of what the situation is, things have changed. And that means your financial situation has. But just because everything is different, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should steer your course for financial ruin. Yes, losing a second income is hard. It can be especially hard if you were living off of one income and now have to go back to the land of the full-time worker. These are some tips and tricks that can help ensure that your divorce doesn&rsquo;t translate to financial ruin.</p>
<h2 id="gather-resources">Gather Resources</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go it alone,&rdquo; says Mike Lynch, vice president of strategic markets at Hartford Funds. &ldquo;Build a team today – a qualified team of legal, tax and investment professionals. Maybe it&rsquo;s your current investment professional, or you may seek a new one that understands your situation better.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re going to want to put together a legal team to help you reach a settlement in regards to child custody and property division. But you might also want to consider bringing on a team of financial professionals to advise you on things such as how your taxes will need to be filed (Alimony and child support can have large financial impact), in addition to how to make money work for you now that there is only you to help pay the bills.</p>
<h2 id="specifics-to-keep-in-mind">Specifics To Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>Certified divorce financial analyst Eva Sachs, Emily McBurney, an attorney and qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO) expert, and certified divorce financial analyst Donna Cheswick also have this advice:</p>
<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<p>Sachs says the first step toward financial independence is balancing your income with your expenses. This can be hard to do if you&rsquo;ve never had to in the past. He advises you sit down and look at how much money is coming in from various avenues like work, alimony and/or child support payments, and then assess how much of that is going toward living expenses. &ldquo;Think of it as a spending plan rathis than a budget,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Knowing whise your money goes is key, especially after divorce. Thise will be many new expenses you might not have thought about prior to your divorce; this is a critical time to refrain from spending money you don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; <strong>Change Your Benefactors</strong> Most likely your spouse was your main benefactor during the marriage, but that is probably not going to be the case moving forward. To remedy this, one of the first things you need to do, is update the beneficiary on your life insurance and retirement accounts. &ldquo;Review all of your accounts and insurance policies and change the beneficiaries. A divorce does <em>not</em> automatically terminate your former spouse’s rights to be the beneficiary on your retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies –- even though your divorce decree might say that your former spouse has waived all rights to the benefits,&rdquo; says McBurney. &ldquo;You will need to formally submit a change of beneficiary form to each financial institution. Othiswise, the benefit will be paid to whoever is listed on their forms at the time of your death &ndash; regardless of your divorce.&rdquo; Take this opportunity to reflect on the people in your life that are around to support you and encourage you. This can be a hard step, changing your beneficiary, because you&rsquo;ve never imagined having to remove your spouse. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want to revise your will, says Cheswick. &ldquo;Meet with an estate planning attorney to discuss your state’s laws regarding possible updates to your will, power of attorney and advanced directives,&rdquo; she suggests. &ldquo;You want to be sure that your former spouse is no longer entitled to any distribution in the event of your death. And if your settlement agreement requires one party to maintain life insurance on the othis, then thise needs to be a method in place to be sure this is actually occurring. Just because the former spouse says they will do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are following through.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="property-division">Property Division</h3>
<p>Marital property division is governed by state laws, but can still get contentious. You will need to check with a family law attorney to see if you live in an equitable distribution state or a community property state. There are four steps to dividing marital property:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify assets owned by you and the assets owned by your spouse</li>
<li>Categorize all assets as &ldquo;marital&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo; property (an attorney can help you determine this)</li>
<li>Assign a value to each asset (you might need an appraiser for thiss)</li>
<li>Devise a plan for the division of assets that is in accordance with state laws</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consider-selling-shared-property">Consider Selling Shared Property</h3>
<p>Instead of fighting over who will retain ownership of the family property, consider selling it and splitting the proceeds. This is a way for each spouse to &ldquo;break even.&rdquo; When it comes to a secondary home, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much more effective to sell the house and distribute the proceeds to the children,&rdquo; says Ric Edelman, chairman and CEO of Edelman Financial Services. &ldquo;You get into the issue of fights amongst the kids – issues of maintenance, repairs and upkeep.&rdquo;  after their divorce is finalized and thise are still outstanding items which have not been resolved,&quot; she said. &ldquo;Remember that the agreement is a legally binding contract that you both signed and agreed to uphold. If one party is failing to comply with the terms of the contract then the othis party has every right to take steps to ensure their compliance including going back to court to have the agreement enforced.&rdquo; <strong>Plan for Retirement</strong> As the divorce gets closer to being finalized, Sachs advises looking to ways of maximizing your retirement savings. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let divorce stop you from planning for your future,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Investing in your 401K plan will allow you to save for retirement. You can begin by saving a small amount each week and then let it build slowly or make payroll contributions that match your employer contributions. Don&rsquo;t stop thinking of the future!&rdquo; Just because you are no longer going to be sharing your golden years with your ex-spouse, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t have the time of your life. Getting your financial situation under control is the first step to taking back your life and claiming your bright future.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>Bruce Dyson&rsquo;s divorced parents have decided to focus on co-parenting - by agreeing to take family portraits every year - as a family.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting-with-family-portraits">Co-Parenting with Family Portraits</h2>
<p>When Victoria Baldwin and ex-husband Adam Dyson realized that the tension between them following their separation was causing their son Bruce anxiety they decided it was time to make a change. “We had a heated discussion in front of our son, who sat crying at my feet,” she recalls. “And I realized the next day I was more focused on hurting his dad than I was on comforting Bruce crying. I knew that wasn’t the example I wanted to set.” Baldwin booked a photo session for herself and her son, and then invited Adam to join along. That one session has become a yearly tradition. As Baldwin wrote on a Facebook posting: “We are not in love, we don’t always agree, we’re not best friends, sometimes we don’t even like one another. But you know what we are? We are forever connected because of our beautiful, smart, kind, compassionate, funny son.” &ldquo;We both agree we’ll continue it,” says Baldwin. “We think a step-parent or long-term partner would be welcomed and would be an addition to Bruce’s life. I have ended potential relationships because they questioned intentions or the quality of Adam and my relationship. We aren’t romantic, but we respect one another. I won’t be with someone who wouldn’t accept that.” Baldwin is just trying to avoid her own situation - her parents divorced when she was very young. As a result she doesn&rsquo;t have a single photo of her family together. “Adam and I are not perfect co-parents, but we made a deal when we got divorced, to put our son first and to value the richness that we each bring to his life, for different reasons,” she writes. “So yes, we still have a family portrait taken, and I still pay good money to have the images printed, framed, and placed in our son’s bedroom; he may not grow up with parents who live in the same house&hellip; but he will grow up to see respect, kindness, empathy, compassion, perseverance, flexibility, and even sacrifice being modeled by both of his parents and he will know it is possible to fall out of love but never fall apart.”</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-co-parenting-relationship">Creating a Co-Parenting Relationship</h2>
<p>Becoming a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">co-parent</a> is difficult, so how can you effectively do it? When people decide to divorce, very often it&rsquo;s their children that take the separation the hardest. When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is totally new and different from what you might expect, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. Now that you&rsquo;re divorced and completely ended your relationship, with all legal aspects neatly tied up, you can continue on with your new single life and never have to deal with your ex again! That is unless you have children. If you do, then you need to put the breaks on a bit. If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be placed in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-is-to-set-boundaries">Step Two is to Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Here are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side when scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, thise are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, thise are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are togethis try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachis conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each othis and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Mel B, formerly of The Spice Girls, made her first public appearance without her wedding ring during the season 12 kickoff of <em>America&rsquo;s Got Talent</em>. This is the first time she&rsquo;s appeared in public since filing for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> from estranged husband of 10 years, Stephen Belafonte.</p>
<h2 id="mel-b-no-longer-wearing-wedding-band">Mel B No Longer Wearing Wedding Band</h2>
<p>Just a few days after it was confirmed that she had filed for divorce, Mel B, 41, was not wearing her wedding band during the kickoff of <em>America&rsquo;s Got Talent</em>.  The singer filed from Belafonte, 41, just one month shy of their 10-year wedding anniversary. The couple was married in June 2007 just after five months of dating. The date of separation in the couple&rsquo;s divorce papers was listed as December 28, 2016. Mel B, who was the one who filed for divorce, requested joint legal and physical custody of their daughter, Madison Brown Belafonte, 5. Additionally, the singer requested to terminate the court’s ability to award spousal support.</p>
<h2 id="options-when-you-want-to-end-marriage">Options When You Want to End Marriage</h2>
<p>There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="divorcehttps619divorcecomsan-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer-san-diego-collaborative-law--divorce-mediation-lawyer"><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">Divorce</a></h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-is-an-option">Legal Separation is an Option</h3>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. Whether the legal separation ends in reconciliation or <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a> there are some rules of engagement you should follow. Here are some tips to consider.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extracurriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="legal-separation-agreement">Legal Separation Agreement</h2>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<h3 id="contained-in-the-legal-separation-agreement">Contained in the Legal Separation Agreement</h3>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-not-divorce">Legal Separation Not Divorce</h3>
<p>Remember that a legal separation is not a divorce. While it gives a couple time and space to decide what the next step is, it is not the official end of a marriage. If you wish to return your legal status to &ldquo;single&rdquo; you will need to file for a legal <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>.</p>
<h3 id="annulment">Annulment</h3>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h3 id="are-celebrity-couples-like-us-or-not">Are Celebrity Couples Like Us, or Not?</h3>
<p>While we all have challenges, celebrity couples have additional, unique challenges the average person doesn&rsquo;t. These include long days, months, and sometimes years on location with their sexy co-stars, and being bombarded with droves of fans who are love-struck trying to get close to them 24-hours every day. Los Angeles resident Laura Jansen, 24, sums it this way, &ldquo;I am just not on the same planet as Demi and Ashton.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="how-celebrity-divorces-might-help">How Celebrity Divorces Might Help</h3>
<p>Celebrity divorces may actually be helpful, though. Many times divorce, whether it&rsquo;s you, your parents, or you or your family&rsquo;s friends, is kept hush-hush because nobody is supposed to talk about it. New York University sociology professor and the author of &ldquo;Going Solo&rdquo; says, &ldquo;While it can be difficult to speak our mind when someone close to us divorces, riffing on Heidi and Seal helps us to process it. We&rsquo;re interested in celebrities&rsquo; revolving-door marriages because so many of us have experienced the same thing among our circle.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="the-upside-in-views-of-marriage">The Upside In Views of Marriage</h3>
<p>Another upside to this view of marriage is the pressure that&rsquo;s taken off women when it comes to getting married. A survey revealed that approximately 33% of women would feel fine checking the &ldquo;single&rdquo; box for the rest of their life. And 59% felt divorce was healthy, especially if the couple fell out of love with each other.  With the Hollywood fantasy of perfect marriages, what do people want and expect from today&rsquo;s marriages? Something truly great! Experts feel this is a high expectation for marriage since it now seems to be an &ldquo;option&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;standard.&rdquo; University of Virginia media studies and sociology professor Andrea L. Press says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real strengthening of the idea that marriage is now about personal growth and fulfillment.&rdquo; And Laura from L.A. says, &ldquo;Getting married is really important to me, but I won&rsquo;t do it unless it&rsquo;s going to be amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>An attorney will help you determine which option is the best option for you and your spouse. They will also be able to ensure that all paperwork is filed correctly.

<p>According to a new Pew Research Center analysis gray <a href="https://bestdivorcelawyer.co/">divorces</a>, those that take place in marriages where people are over the age of 50, have doubled since 1990.</p>
<h2 id="number-of-gray-divorces-are-doubling">Number of Gray Divorces are Doubling</h2>
<p>Gray <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> is when a couple decides, after a long marriage of a decade or more, that they want to end their marriage. According to the data recently released from the Pew Research Center, divorce rates among adults older than 50 have doubled since 1990 while divorce rates for those younger than 40 have declined.   But why do couples split after 20+ years of marriage? Is there a big event that happens? Or do smaller things lead up to it? Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the reasons.</p>
<h4 id="peoplegrow-apart">People Grow Apart</h4>
<p>Just as with any divorce, and any relationship for that matter, there is always a chance for two people to just grow apart and become interested in other things. Or little things build up. According to author of <em>Wired for Love</em> Stan Tatkin says, “It’s like an unbreakable plate you drop repeatedly. The relationship develops microcracks inside the structure you can’t see. Then it finally reaches a critical mass and shatters.” There can be an undercurrent of dissatisfaction that evolves for many reasons. According to Tatkin, “Often one person — usually the woman — feels she’s given up too much. She may have put aside her career as she raised the children. She feels the wear and tear of the relationship because it wasn’t collaborative.”</p>
<h3 id="age-is-a-factor">Age is a Factor</h3>
<p>Other times age is a factor. A  big age difference that was not an issue at the beginning of a relationship may become a problem later in life, Tatkin says. Or people may hit middle-age and crave a reboot. As Tatkin explains, as people age they go through physiological and biological “brain upgrades.” This can happen at 15 and can happen at 40. It&rsquo;s the whole reasoning behind a mid-life crisis. “Every time you experience one [of these brain upgrades] you want to go back [in time],” he says.</p>
<h4 id="couples-are-bored">Couples are Bored</h4>
<p>Steve Siebold, a psychological performance and mental toughness coach and author of 177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class, believes that boredom can play a part in gray divorce.  “Being around the same person 24/7, depending on the relationship, can lead to boredom,” he says. Additionally, people often just stop trying and become complacent. “You work hard, play hard and take care of business, but you’ve stopped being the attentive, attractive spouse. You’ve allowed yourself to become complacent.”</p>
<h4 id="differences-in-spending-habits">Differences in Spending Habits</h4>
<p>Money and finances are always a sticking point for married couples. Financial problems can be even greater when two spouses have different spending habits - like one is a saver and the other is a spender. According to Siebold, “The kids’ activities, expenses and college funds eat the family’s discretionary cash and you’re deep in debt.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="sexual-incompatibility">Sexual Incompatibility</h3>
<p>Any sexual incompatibility that might have existed throughout the time of the relationship can become more pronounced, says Jessica O’Reilly, author of <em>The New Sex Bible</em>.  “Hormonal changes that arise with age can cause significant shifts in sex drive. And though every couple of every age experiences differentials in desire, these can become more pronounced with age.” Whatever your reason is for divorcing, you&rsquo;ll want to know what the process is.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children, as is quite common among gray divorces. Knowing this, if you are divorcing after a long marriage, chances are there will be a lot to figure out when it comes to dividing marital property and assets. Below is an overview of the divorce process. As is always advised, but especially advised for couples that will need to figure out a lot aspects of their marriage, you&rsquo;ll want to work with <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">a divorce attorney</a> that can advise you on your divorce.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-divorce-process">Starting the Divorce Process</h2>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo; Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. It should be noted that Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together, and have few assets and debts. This is most likely not the best option for those going through a gray divorce. Most likely, you will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-note-on-property-division">A quick note on property division:</h3>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/">Property division</a> is a big aspect of the agreement process of divorce, and one that will most likely affect those who are involved in a gray divorce. Major assets include: homes, furniture, artwork, jewelry, and appliances. Property is decided according to your state&rsquo;s specific laws. This has the potential to be very litigious during a divorce, especially a divorce that follows many years of marriage. <strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inherited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highis wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court.

<p>During a recent appearance on <em>The Doctors</em>, Tarek El Moussa of HGTV&rsquo;s <em>Flip or Flop</em> offered his take on why his marriage to Christina El Moussa failed.</p>
<h2 id="flip-or-flop-star-talks-about-divorce">Flip or Flop Star Talks About Divorce</h2>
<p>Last December the <em>Flip or Flop</em> stars announced they would be getting divorce following eight-month separation and seven years of marriage. Tarek recently appeared on the talk show <em>The Doctors</em> to speak about his marriage and what he believes to be the reason it didn&rsquo;t last. Tarek cites the couple&rsquo;s growing fame in addition to dealing with the stresss of his cancer diagnosis are what finally broke the couple&rsquo;s marriage. &ldquo;I feel like if we had better communication, we would have had a better relationship,&rdquo; he said during the interview. &ldquo;I think as time went on, as you get busier and busier. It was like overnight: businesses, TV, all these things happened overnight, then the cancer, then the cancer, and the back surgery. It just kind of started pushing us apart from each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be lying if I said it was easy,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;But like anything, there&rsquo;s ups and downs and you have challenges, but at the end of the day, we&rsquo;re just normal people. What&rsquo;s most important is the family and the kids. It&rsquo;s really important that we stayed positive&hellip;It was an emotional rollercoaster, physical rollercoaster, I had 60-pound weight swings,&rdquo; he reveals of his cancer battle. &ldquo;For the first time in a long, long time I feel really good. It was a miserable three years.&ldquo;Tarek is now cancer free and both have moved on romantically since the end of their marriage. Is your marriage on the rocks? Here are a couple of warning signs you&rsquo;ll want to look for. As is always advised, if you are considering divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to work with a family law attorney that can guide you through the divorce process.</p>
<h2 id="signs-your-marriage-is-on-the-rocks">Signs Your Marriage Is On The Rocks</h2>
<p>The following signs could indicate that your marriage needs some help.</p>
<h3 id="youre-not-happy">You&rsquo;re not happy.</h3>
<p>Sure, every relationship has its ups and downs but constantly feeling unhappy is a clear sign that this isn&rsquo;t good anymore.</p>
<h3 id="the-majority-of-your-interactions-are-not-positive">The majority of your interactions are not positive.</h3>
<p>According to marriage researcher John Gottman, happy couples have an interaction ratio of 20:1 — that&rsquo;s 20 positive interactions to 1 negative interaction. Conflicted couples have a ratio of 5:1, and couples nearing divorce are .8:1.</p>
<h3 id="you-create-reasons-to-avoid-your-partner">You create reasons to avoid your partner.</h3>
<p>If you are avoiding your partner or creating reasons to avoid your partner, you should consider talking with a marital therapist. Examples are sitting in the car to avoid going inside your house or wanting to hang out more with friends and family instead of at home.</p>

<p>If every interaction feels like a chore or is painful, like deciding on breakfast or when to go to the grocery story, you&rsquo;ll want to consider if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<p>In most good relationships, couples value the same &lsquo;big&rsquo; things. But that can change over time. Often times what one person used to value doesn&rsquo;t&rsquo; matter much over time.

<h2 id="are-these-signs-ringing-a-bell"><strong>Are these signs ringing a bell?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have more than 2-3 of the signs listed above you might want to spend some time to sit down and have an open conversation with your spouse. If that is not possible, you might want to consider speaking with a marital therapist that can advise you on how to have an open conversation with your spouse. If after reading these signs, and you decide that you want a divorce and that there is no way you can work things out with your spouse, you should consider calling a family law attorney.</p>
<h2 id="the-divorce-process">The Divorce Process</h2>
<p>Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different, and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court.

<p>&ldquo;Life or death experiences may cause people to re-evaluate what’s important in their lives.&rdquo; A new study in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior states that 6% of marriages end in <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="(619) DIVORCE - 619 Divorce">divorce</a> if the wife has been diagnosed with a serious illness compared to if the wife is healthy. This gives a whole new meaning to the &ldquo;in sickness and in health&rdquo; part of the marriage vows.</p>
<h2 id="study-of-marriage-and-divorce">Study of Marriage and Divorce</h2>
<p>The study, which covered a decade, looked at data from 2,701 marriages whise one spouse was 50 years or older and their spouse has been diagnosed as having a serious illness. The study required the 50 and older spouse to be 50 at the time the study began. Of the marriages looked at, approximately a third ended in divorce, while a quarter ended in the death of their spouse. The study found that a husband&rsquo;s illness had no affect on the chance for a divorce, only a wife&rsquo;s illness.</p>
<h3 id="stress-caused-by-illness-may-be-the-cause">Stress Caused by Illness May Be the Cause</h3>
<p>Although the study didn&rsquo;t look into how the spouse&rsquo;s illness led to the divorce, according to Amelia Karraker, the lead author, she believes the illness led to additional stress in the marriage. Karraker, who is an assistant professor at Iowa State in human development and family studies, says the data doesn&rsquo;t explain exactly why, thise are various reasons associated with stress that can damage a marriage, even if the marriage is strong. An example she provides is when a healthy spouse becomes the primary caregiver in addition to being the sole manager and provider of the household.  &ldquo;Thise is a difference between feeling too sick to make dinner and needing someone to actually feed you. That’s something that can really change the dynamics within a marriage,&rdquo; according to Karraker. &ldquo;If your spouse is too sick to work, we know that financial strain is a major predictor of divorce in and of itself.&rdquo; And quality provided by the care is also a factor. &ldquo;Wives are generally less satisfied with the care from their husbands,&rdquo; said Karraker. This is probably due to the reason that men, particularly older men, have not be brought up to become a &ldquo;caregiver&rdquo; the way women have been raised. Because of this they&rsquo;re not as comfortable in taking on the role of caregiver. &ldquo;It could be that women are saying, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re doing a bad job of caring for me,&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not happy with this,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the relationship to begin with.&rsquo;&rdquo; Karraker furthis says, &ldquo;Life or death experiences may cause people to re-evaluate what&rsquo;s important in their lives.&rdquo; Basically, it can make a person re-evaluate their life&rsquo;s future and what they really would like to do with their time. Karraker and Kenzie Latham, a fellow colleague who is an assistant professor at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, indicated that the data which was recording as part of a Health and Retirement Study, didn&rsquo;t indicate which spouse, the wife or the husband, initiated the divorce. Karraker thinks women may initiate more divorces due to eithis the care they were or weren&rsquo;t receiving.</p>
<h3 id="stressors-of-marriage">Stressors of Marriage</h3>
<p>Thise are always hardships that spouses have that can affect their relationship. Psychologists refer to these hardships as &ldquo;marital stressors.&rdquo; These stressors can include external circumstances or events that eithis threaten or challenge a marriage and includes unemployment, infidelity, financial problems, parenting issues, a child&rsquo;s death, in-law problems, and as indicated by the study a spouse&rsquo;s chronic illness. The effects of these can be subtle, making spouses drift apart even if thise is no outward conflict between them.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-marriage-stressors">Working With Marriage Stressors</h3>
<p>Stress affects marriage in different ways. Some things you can explore include infidelity or financial problems. Before giving up on your marriage due to outside problems, seek professional help first. If your marriage has been stressed because of chronic illness, some suggestions include: <strong>Accept offers to help.</strong> Family and friends can give great support when things get stressful because of a spouse&rsquo;s illness. This could be in the way of cooking dinners, cleaning house, or just giving moral support. <strong>Find and join a support group.</strong> Thise are many online resources and references from your doctor&rsquo;s office to find referrals to support groups. If you can&rsquo;t find one, think about creating a group of your own. Chances are thise are othis caregivers who are also looking for ways to get them through their tough times. <strong>Find a good counselor.</strong> A thisapist and/or psychiatrist can help with the stress a chronic illness puts on your marriage. These counselors are experts when it comes to helping both individuals as well as couples to work through their more emotionally tough times. Keep in mind it&rsquo;s okay to be angry. When a diagnosis of a chronic illness is given for you or your spouse, it&rsquo;s natural to be upset and mad, or have feelings of being unfair and/or overwhelming. A common feeling is anger and hopelessness. A psychiatrist and/or thisapist can help you work through these feelings and deal with your anger over this traumatic turn of events in your life.</p>
<h3 id="does-illness-type-matter">Does Illness Type Matter?</h3>
<p>Thise were four different chronic illnesses that the researchiss focused on to determine if the eithis the type or severity impacted the rates of divorce. The four illness were heart disease, lung disease, cancer, and stroke. Although thise were slight differences, the results for each were statistically insignificant.</p>
<h3 id="inspired-by-politicians">Inspired by Politicians</h3>
<p>What sparked and inspired Karraker&rsquo;s study was the criticism politicians such as Newt Gingrich and John Edwards received after they divorced their ill wives. Being an assistant professor of human development and family studies, she heard from othis women who had experienced similar situation while she was doing his study. He also heard from friends who also experienced divorce after being diagnosed with their illness.</p>
<h3 id="grey-divorce-trend">&ldquo;Grey Divorce&rdquo; Trend</h3>
<p>According to othis studies, couples are divorcing later in life in a trend referred to as &ldquo;grey divorce.&rdquo; Perhaps it&rsquo;s because people are living longer, but the trend, which started in the early 1980&rsquo;s, became formally recognized with the label in 2004. AARP conducted a study in May 2004 named &ldquo;The Divorce Experience: A Study of Divorce at Midlife and Beyond&rdquo; which collected data about grey divorce. Some of their findings include:</p>
<h3 id="who-initiates-a-grey-divorce">Who initiates a grey divorce</h3>
<ul>
<li>66% of female participants initiated the divorce</li>
<li>41% of male participants initiated the divorce</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="participants-age-at-time-of-divorce">Participants age at time of divorce</h3>
<ul>
<li>Age 40-49, 73% of divorced in their 40&rsquo;s</li>
<li>Age 50-59, 22% of divorced in their 50&rsquo;s</li>
<li>Age 60-Older, 4% of divorced in their 60&rsquo;s or later</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="widowhood-vs-divorce">Widowhood vs. Divorce</h3>
<p>In the study done by Karraker, it&rsquo;s important to realize that before grey divorce became popular because of longer lifespans, more people would end up widowed instead of divorced. &ldquo;In the past, some marriages would have ended because of widowhood instead of divorce,&rdquo; said Karraker. Karraker and Latham compared their marriage results to samples that ended in divorce due to a spouse&rsquo;s illness in order to complete their study. Of the marriages that Karraker and Latham studied, 32% ended in a divorce compared to 24% that ended in widowhood. In younger respondents, divorce was a more common way to end their marriage. In older respondents, death was the more likely cause of ending the marriage. They concluded that chances of widowhood increased 5$ if husbands were ill and 4% when wives were ill. Previous studies on this subject found married couples have better mental as well as physical health. In the Karraker study it&rsquo;s interesting to note that his research indicated a woman&rsquo;s illness increases the risk of losing the health benefits provided by marriage. &ldquo;I think the research shows the potential vulnerabilities for people in society who are sick. Thise is an elevated risk for depression with illness and now you’re also at risk for divorce,&rdquo; said Karraker. &ldquo;People in poor health may have less access to beneficial social relationships, which in turn can compromise their health furthis.&rdquo; If you have explored all possible avenues to deal with the marital stressors in your life and feel divorce is the only possible course for you, you need to skilled advice of a divorce attorney such as (619) Divorce. Divorce is a difficult time and a divorce attorney can help you navigate the steps required to dissolve your marriage, including decisions about child custody and visitation, marital property division, and spousal support.

<p>Former NFL receiver Robert Meachem has been sent to jail for 30 days unless he is able to pay a portion of the child support he owes to his ex-wife.</p>
<h2 id="meachem-in-jail-for-child-support">Meachem in Jail for Child Support</h2>
<p>Former New Orleans Saints receiver Robert Meachem, 32, has received a jail sentence of 30 days unless he is able to pay $100,000 of the $388,019 of support owed his two children and his ex-wife. The child support amount was set following Meachem&rsquo;s 2014 divorce when he was employed by the Saints and making an $855,000 salary. It seems unlikely that Meachem will be able to repay the amount as he is currently unemployed by any football team and has not played for a team since 2014.</p>
<h2 id="child-support">Child Support</h2>
<p>, and you receive a petition for child support, you respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-a-child-support-petition">Receiving a Child Support Petition</h2>
<p>Once you receive a child support petition, you must follow the instructions on that petition. This often means you will need to appear in court on a specific date. During the court hearing, a judge will examine your income, the othis parent&rsquo;s income, how much time the child spends with each parent, as well as any special circumstances regarding day care or medical expenses, and then determine how much you will pay in child support.</p>
<h2 id="child-support-hearing">Child Support Hearing</h2>
<p>To prepare for the child support hearing, you need to put togethis and bring the following to court: evidence of your income and any othis court requested documents. If you do not believe you are the fathis of the child, and you have not been legally stated as the fathis, you are able to request a paternity test. If this request is accepted, the child will need to submit to the test before you are required to make child support payments.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-appear-or-pay">Failure to Appear or Pay</h3>
<p>If you do not appear at the child support hearing, or do not make child support payments as ordered by the court, then the court can take measures to collect the unpaid payments. This might mean garnishing your wages, suspension of your driver&rsquo;s license, or over legal actions, such as jail time and fines.</p>
<h2 id="tomlinson-and-jungwirth-co-parenting">Tomlinson and Jungwirth Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>In February Tomlinson purchased a home in Calabasas for Jungwirth and his son. He appears to be renting a $49,000 a month home in the Hollywood Hills to be close to his son so that he can be a more available to co-parent. Though it seems that Tomlinson and Jungwirth are on good terms, co-parenting can be very difficult - especially if you are not fond of the person you are expected to co-parent with. This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Here are some steps you can follow: <strong>Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</strong> In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse. <strong>Step Two is to Set Boundaries</strong> The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>After 22 years of marriage, <em>Jerry McGuire</em> star Cuba Gooding Jr. has decided to officially end his marriage and has filed for divorce.</p>
<h2 id="cuba-gooding-jr-ends-marriage">Cuba Gooding Jr. Ends Marriage</h2>
<p>Three years after she filed for legal separation, Cuba Gooding Jr. has filed for divorce from his wife Sara Kapfer. The two were high school sweethearts and have three children together - sons Spencer and Mason and daughter, Piper. They were married on March 13, 1994. In April 2014 Kapfer filed for legal separation citing irreconcilable differences. At the time, the 2014 documents stated that Kapfer sought joint legal and physical custody of their two children (who were minors at the time) and also requested spousal support. In the new divorce documents, the <em>American Crime Story</em> actor is asking for joint legal custody and physical custody of their daughter Piper, 10. It also states that Gooding Jr. is willing to pay spousal support. He has also requested that he keep all of his earnings from the date Kapfer filed for separation.  </p>
<h2 id="options-when-you-want-to-end-marriage">Options When You Want to End Marriage</h2>
<p>There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="divorcehttps619divorcecomsan-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer-san-diego-collaborative-law--divorce-mediation-lawyer"><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">Divorce</a></h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-is-an-option">Legal Separation is an Option</h3>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. Whether the legal separation ends in reconciliation or <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a> there are some rules of engagement you should follow. Here are some tips to consider.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extracurriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="legal-separation-agreement">Legal Separation Agreement</h2>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<h3 id="contained-in-the-legal-separation-agreement">Contained in the Legal Separation Agreement</h3>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-not-divorce">Legal Separation Not Divorce</h3>
<p>Remember that a legal separation is not a divorce. While it gives a couple time and space to decide what the next step is, it is not the official end of a marriage. If you wish to return your legal status to &ldquo;single&rdquo; you will need to file for a legal <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>.</p>
<h3 id="annulment">Annulment</h3>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h3 id="are-celebrity-couples-like-us-or-not">Are Celebrity Couples Like Us, or Not?</h3>
<p>While we all have challenges, celebrity couples have additional, unique challenges the average person doesn&rsquo;t. These include long days, months, and sometimes years on location with their sexy co-stars, and being bombarded with droves of fans who are love-struck trying to get close to them 24-hours every day. Los Angeles resident Laura Jansen, 24, sums it this way, &ldquo;I am just not on the same planet as Demi and Ashton.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="how-celebrity-divorces-might-help">How Celebrity Divorces Might Help</h3>
<p>Celebrity divorces may actually be helpful, though. Many times divorce, whether it&rsquo;s you, your parents, or you or your family&rsquo;s friends, is kept hush-hush because nobody is supposed to talk about it. New York University sociology professor and the author of &ldquo;Going Solo&rdquo; says, &ldquo;While it can be difficult to speak our mind when someone close to us divorces, riffing on Heidi and Seal helps us to process it. We&rsquo;re interested in celebrities&rsquo; revolving-door marriages because so many of us have experienced the same thing among our circle.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="the-upside-in-views-of-marriage">The Upside In Views of Marriage</h3>
<p>Another upside to this view of marriage is the pressure that&rsquo;s taken off women when it comes to getting married. A survey revealed that approximately 33% of women would feel fine checking the &ldquo;single&rdquo; box for the rest of their life. And 59% felt divorce was healthy, especially if the couple fell out of love with each other.  With the Hollywood fantasy of perfect marriages, what do people want and expect from today&rsquo;s marriages? Something truly great! Experts feel this is a high expectation for marriage since it now seems to be an &ldquo;option&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;standard.&rdquo; University of Virginia media studies and sociology professor Andrea L. Press says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real strengthening of the idea that marriage is now about personal growth and fulfillment.&rdquo; And Laura from L.A. says, &ldquo;Getting married is really important to me, but I won&rsquo;t do it unless it&rsquo;s going to be amazing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The $4,100 that Sherri Shepherd pays to estranged husband Lamar Sally might not be enough - according to Sally.</p>
<h2 id="more-child-support-drama-for-sherri-shepherd">More Child Support Drama for Sherri Shepherd</h2>
<p>Last December, Sally requested an increase in the child support he receives from Shepherd. Shepherd has now fired back, claiming that the request is outrageous. Sally has argued that the child suffers from a medical condition that requires more money to take care of him. In court documents, Shepherd claimed that she did not feel a California judge had the legal right to increase the amount she  already pays. “The court dismissed this action after finding that this court lacks jurisdiction over Respondent and the issue of modifying a child support order issued in New Jersey, which is continuing exclusive jurisdiction,” the documents state.</p>
<h3 id="judge-ruled-shepherd-must-pay-child-support">Judge Ruled Shepherd Must Pay Child Support</h3>
<p>Last November a Pennsylvania court of appeals ruled in favor of upholding a prior decision that Sherri Shepherd pay <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-support-lawyer/">child support</a>.  The ex co-host of ABC&rsquo;s <em>The View</em> is officially legally responsible for a child that was born to a surrogate that her and her ex-husband Lamar Sally hired before they decided to divorce. The Pennsylvania appeals ruled to uphold the surrogacy contract despite the fact that Shepherd was seeking to have the contract voided and her name removed from the child&rsquo;s birth certificate. During the hearing, it was ruled the TV personality must pay $4,100 a month in child support to her ex-husband who is raising the 1-year-old boy in Los Angeles. The couple paid over $105,000 to secure a suburban Philadelphia surrogate to conceive through. The child was conceived through Sally&rsquo;s sperm and a donor egg. When the couple decided to divorce in the second trimester of the pregnancy, Shepherd challenged the surrogacy contract, claiming that she had been duped into signing it in order for Sally to eventually receive child support payments. Sally then retaliated, saying that Shepherd was refusing to have anything to do with the child. &ldquo;I don’t understand why Sherri can say I duped her into this or that she is not responsible for this child,&rdquo; he said in an interview with <em>The Daily Mail</em>. &ldquo;It’s mind-boggling to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want to be part of his life. It&rsquo;s all good,&rdquo; said Sally following the latest decision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be parent enough for the both of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>actions and express agreement to be the child&rsquo;s legal mother.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="determining-child-custody-and-child-support">Determining Child Custody and Child Support</h2>
<p>One of the hardest determinations that must be made during a divorce is what happens with the children. Child custody can lead to years of trials and trial fees, not to mention the emotional toll it takes on a family, and the children involved.</p>
<h2 id="child-custody">Child Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h3>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="child-support">Child Support</h2>
<p>, and you receive a petition for child support, you respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-a-child-support-petition">Receiving a Child Support Petition</h2>
<p>Once you receive a child support petition, you must follow the instructions on that petition. This often means you will need to appear in court on a specific date. During the court hearing, a judge will examine your income, the othis parent&rsquo;s income, how much time the child spends with each parent, as well as any special circumstances regarding day care or medical expenses, and then determine how much you will pay in child support.</p>
<h2 id="child-support-hearing">Child Support Hearing</h2>
<p>To prepare for the child support hearing, you need to put togethis and bring the following to court: evidence of your income and any othis court requested documents. If you do not believe you are the fathis of the child, and you have not been legally stated as the fathis, you are able to request a paternity test. If this request is accepted, the child will need to submit to the test before you are required to make child support payments.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-appear-or-pay">Failure to Appear or Pay</h3>
<p>If you do not appear at the child support hearing, or do not make child support payments as ordered by the court, then the court can take measures to collect the unpaid payments. This might mean garnishing your wages, suspension of your driver&rsquo;s license, or over legal actions, such as jail time and fines.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting-in-a-high-conflict-relationship">Co-Parenting in a High Conflict Relationship</h2>
<p>While Lamar Sally might have full custody of the couple&rsquo;s son, often times a couple will need to work together to co-parent. This can be especially hard if two parents do not see eye-to-eye, as is the typical case with divorced couples. Here are some Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s when it comes to creating a co-parenting relationship: <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other of any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A successful co-parenting relationship is the best way to ensure that your kids feel supported and loved during what can be a difficult time. They want to see their parents get along, even if at a bare minimum. It&rsquo;s up to you and your ex to create a positive relationship that will be supportive of your shared interest: your children.</p>

<p>Figuring out child support is one of the most difficult agreements to come to when figuring out a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce settlement</a>. Who will pay for after school activities and health care and&hellip; college? When it comes to applying for college tuition financial aid, co-parenting can become even harder than it already might be.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting-and-applying-for-college-tuition">Co-Parenting and Applying for College Tuition</h2>
<p>If you have a child, there will most likely come a point in your life where you have to deal with filling out applications for college financial aid. As college tuition has risen over the years, and with more and more kids going to college, it&rsquo;s only an inevitable that you, as a parent, will have to deal with the application process. This application process is not a fun one, and one that can be even less fun when you have to factor in your divorce and co-parenting status.</p>
<h2 id="figuring-out-co-parenting">Figuring Out Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>By now you might have figured out the co-parenting situation, but for those that haven&rsquo;t, here&rsquo;s a quick overview: If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. If you&rsquo;re newly <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorced</a>, right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be place in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-is-to-set-boundaries">Step Two is to Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>

<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>

<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>There are certain things that any child will need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting-through-the-college-financial-aid-application-process">Co-Parenting Through the College Financial Aid Application Process</h2>
<p>In establishing co-parenting relationships, we often talk about one thing: the ability to reach common ground because it is in your child&rsquo;s best interest. Chances are you and your spouse can both agree that higher education is the step you want for your child. Therefore, you&rsquo;re both going to need to work together to get the applications done. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA is the application you will need to fill out in order to apply for federally funded student aid.</p>
<h3 id="custodial-parent">Custodial Parent?</h3>
<p>One of the first things the application asks for is for you to list custodial parent. According to Tiffany and Clay Clem, two parents that are going through the process right now, that&rsquo;s a loaded question. &ldquo;&lsquo;Custody&rsquo; is not the legal meaning, not the tax meaning,&rdquo; Clay explains. &ldquo;If I am determined the custodial parent, my ex might get upset and say &lsquo;What do you mean I am not custodial?!&rsquo; They should use a different word.&rdquo; The FAFSA specifies &ldquo;custody&rdquo; as the parent with whom the child has lived for the most during the past year. When parents share joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">custody</a>, the FAFSA offers a second test to establish which household provided more financial support during the previous year.  According to Clay, &ldquo;that guidance is very ambiguous.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="dont-give-out-too-much-info">Don&rsquo;t Give Out Too Much Info</h3>
<p>When it comes to listing family members, make sure you don&rsquo;t list everyone&rsquo;s financial information. According to Scott Weingold, managing director of the College Planning Network, listing mom&rsquo;s, dad&rsquo;s, stepmom&rsquo;s, and stepdad&rsquo;s financial information can be a costly mistake. &ldquo;You may be over-reporting your income,&rdquo; Weingold says. When you list everyone on the application, even when it has not been asked for, it can make it appear as if you have more income than you truly do.&ldquo;A family that could have gotten aid from a school may be getting nothing now because it looks like they have more money available than they do.&rdquo; Weingold advises you only provide information for the custodial parent. If the custodial parent has remarried, you&rsquo;ll need to supply the step-parent&rsquo;s information. The FAFSA will also ask you to include how much child support is received.</p>
<h3 id="working-things-through-with-a-difficult-ex">Working Things Through With a Difficult Ex</h3>
<p>As Naomi Elliot knows, this process can be very difficult when the relationship between both parents is strained. Naomi has sought to have as little contact with her ex as possible. That&rsquo;s why her and her son Simon decided that he only apply to schools that would base their financial aid decisions on the custodial parent&rsquo;s income. She is the custodial parent and was unsure that Simon&rsquo;s father would provide Simon with any money for college. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t afford a penny of his education,&rdquo; says Naomi, a real estate agent in Massachusetts. &ldquo;The divorce wiped me out. I knew that I needed a financial package that was significant and didn&rsquo;t ask me or my son to take out loans.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="during-divorce-agreement">During Divorce Agreement</h3>
<p>One thing that might help, is ensuring that the tuition debate is decided on during the divorce agreement. While this can be a very difficult part of the process, deciding on it sooner rather than later can help you avoid a hassle when the application time comes around.</p>

<p>His relationship with his husband had already been strained prior to his mother&rsquo;s death. He knew they were headed to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, bneitherhis one of them had formally said the words. But after his death, after being consumed with grief, it was just too much to pretend that his husband could make his happy anymore. Anymore&hellip; At one point, when they first met, they were happy. The perfect picture of happiness, in fact. They had met through a mutual friend. <em>He</em> had been corralled into going to a trivia night at a local bar by a friend. The same friend had talked <em>him</em> into going that night too. When their eyes met for the first time, it was love. Instant love. The kind of love that only happens in movies. It had smacked both of them right in the face. They immediately set a dinner date. After two years of dating, and during their anniversary trip to Paris, he had gotten down on one knee in front of the Eiffel Tower. It really was perfect.  A year later, at the local country club, they were married in front of family and friends. Their mutual friend spoke that night at the reception, taking credit for how she was responsible for the two of them ever meeting. Well, his, and the fact that the two of them had both known the answer to an obscure trivia question. Now, five years later, following the sobering life moment that comes with the loss of a mother, and with the addition of a beautiful house and a two year old, they had found the only way they could continue living - by divorcing.</p>
<h3 id="something-had-changed">Something Had Changed</h3>
<p>Something had changed between them. Maybe it was the long hours she spent working as a successful realtor. Or maybe the fact that despite the fact that he was home all day with their son, he still couldn&rsquo;t manage to get the dishes put away or the clothes clean. &ldquo;What does he do all day?&rdquo; she wondered. Sure, she knew their son could be rambunctious. He <em>was</em> two! But seriously, couldn&rsquo;t his husband find some way of getting things done? What had happened to the successful and organized account manager she had fallen in love with? He knew she was not without his faults. Sure, she had had that flirtation with a co-worker a year ago. But nothing had happened. He knew she could catch the eye of any man she wanted. In fact, she had sold a few homes using his flirting techniques. But she had never actually gone through with anything. Their financial situation was fine. They were just growing apart. And then his mother died. He was swallowed up by grief. Work seemed pointless. Why go to work day in and day out when all that happens in life is that you end up in a little box in the ground? Despite his extreme sadness, his husband still could not figure out how to do any housework. He was starting to resent him. A deep, dark resentment. The kind that&rsquo;s been building up for years, ready to explode during any little argument. The well had been poisoned a while ago, maybe always, she thought. Maybe the only thing they had ever had in common was that they both knew the answer to that obscure trivia question.</p>
<h3 id="a-question-of-divorce">A Question of Divorce</h3>
<p>How would she divorce him though? He hadn&rsquo;t worked in years. If he couldn&rsquo;t even figure out how to do the laundry how was he supposed to know how to take care of himself, or file papers for that matter. He knew she would need to support him with <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">alimony payments</a>. And what about their son. He knew she could trust his husband with him, but could she trust him to be able to still do so if he had to go back to work? What would they do for the holidays? He loved spending Christmas morning watching his son ripping open his presents. What if this year she didn&rsquo;t get to have that morning? Would his and his husband be able to pull it togethis enough to raise this child togethis? They could be civil now, but she was unsure of how he would react once he received the papers. He decided to meet with a divorce attorney. After calling a few and performing some phone interviews she had decided to go with one that was firm, but not too pushy. He didn&rsquo;t want his husband to feel attacked. During the first meeting they had discussed all the particulars of his marriage: the house, their son, his position of breadwinner, his position of home-maker. His mothis had left his a small, but substantial amount of money. , a process that has been known to help decrease litigation costs. In working through the mediation process, a couple is able to decide on all aspects of a marriage through the help of a team of licensed professionals. Taking this approach has proven to avoid the often painful and drawn out nature of a traditional divorce case. The neutral parties help the divorcing parties come to a decision they can both agree on.</p>
<h3 id="a-year-later-following-the-divorce">A Year Later Following the Divorce</h3>
<p>A year later, following an emotional mediation process, the two were divorced. They had worked out a co-parenting schedule that suited them both. It had been a transition for all of them. His husband and his had both decided to sell the house as part of the divorce process. They had been advised that this was financially the best way for both of them. His apartment was only about 10 minutes away from hiss and very close to whise their house was, so their son was able to stay at the same school and keep his same friends. They wanted to keep some sense of normalcy for him. That was important to both of them. He spent one week with his husband, and one week with his. Of course, if for whatever reason he wanted to visit anothis parent he could, regardless of whose week it was. They wanted to remain flexible, and had been advised that would be the best for their son. While she would not be spending Christmas morning with his son this year, she had compromised and decided that getting him for Christmas Eve would be a fine arrangement. Things were still tense when she saw his ex-husband, but they were managing. Every day it got a little easier. Some days were really hard. During those days she tried to surround hisself wit or keep hisself busy. He had recently gotten into running and it helped to ease his mind. While the divorce wasn&rsquo;t easy, she was happy she could finally move forward with his new life.</p>

<p>Brad Pitt has been cleared of any wrongdoing following an investigation of a possible child abuse incident involving his eldest son, Maddox.  Now that he&rsquo;s been cleared, what will this determination mean for the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> arrangement he has with estranged wife Angelina Jolie?</p>
<h2 id="brad-pitt-cleared-of-any-wrongdoing">Brad Pitt Cleared of Any Wrongdoing</h2>
<p>The Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) cleared Brad Pitt of any wrongdoing following an investigation of an alleged incident of child abuse involving Pitt and his son, Maddox. The accusation was made just one day before estranged wife Angelina Jolie filed for divorce. The two were married for just two years.</p>
<p>According to her divorce paperwork, Jolie is seeking sole physical custody of the couple&rsquo;s six children &ndash; Maddox, 15; Pax, 12; Zahara, 11; Shiloh, 10; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8. Last week Pitt filed his response to Jolie&rsquo;s divorce filing and requested joint custody of their children.</p>
<p>As part of their current agreement, which was created as just an initial &ldquo;solve&rdquo; following the divorce filing, Jolie has custody, while Pitt is allowed &ldquo;therapeutic visits&rdquo; with his children.</p>
<p>One of the hardest parts of the divorce process is, undoubtedly, figuring out <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">child custody arrangements</a>. When it comes down to making decisions, the court will always rule in the best interests of a child, even when those best wishes go against a parent&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<h2 id="child-custody">Child Custody</h2>
<p>In California, the law provides judges with certain guidelines when it comes to child custody decisions. While a court will often favor joint custody, where both parents play a role in child-rearing, there are exceptions where shared parenting might not be possible. Therefore, there is an order of preference in place when it comes to child custody arrangements, as is demonstrated below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joint custody</li>
<li>Sole custody. In this instance, a judge will decide on the custodial parent.</li>
<li>Non-parent custody. In this instance, a judge may rule it is best for a child to live with someone other than a parent.</li>
<li>Suitable Persons</li>
</ul>
<p>A judge will weigh all information provided regarding the parents and the child before awarding custody. Judges are also given broad discretion in cases, so that the child&rsquo;s best interests are met. <strong>Additional Factors</strong> The California Family Code outlines what a judge will consider when deciding on child custody disputes. These various factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Child’s health and welfare</li>
<li>Physical abuse</li>
<li>History of violent crimes</li>
<li>Parental drug or alcohol abuse</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-child-custody-case">Your Child Custody Case</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody</a> cases can get combative. Typically, both parents want equal time with their children. But all too often a parent will try to argue that the other parent isn&rsquo;t fit to raise a child. Hise are some things you can do to protect yourself when entering a litigious child custody case.</p>
<h2 id="record-everything">Record Everything</h2>
<p>When resolving <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the other parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the other parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the child or children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the other parent</li>
<li>If the other parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the other parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions. Being able to remove any emotions you have about the other parent will help you stay focused on creating an unbiased record. State the facts and try to keep the emotions out of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>
<p>Using a spiral notebook, Excel document, or any other form that will help you keep track of every interaction, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Times of calls or visits</li>
<li>Topics discussed (either between you or the other spouse or between the other spouse and your child or children). This does not have to mean an invasion of privacy, but if you&rsquo;re able to get a gauge of what was discussed between your child or children and the other parent it only builds a stronger case</li>
<li>Duration of phone call or visit</li>
<li>Was the interaction spontaneous or part of a pre-arranged visitation schedule?</li>
<li>How the child or children felt prior to the visit or call, as well as after</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionaltips"> <strong>Additional Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent in your record keeping. If that means setting a daily time to record anything that has happened, then do so. Waiting days or weeks to record an interaction will make it difficult for you to remember specifics.</li>
<li>Be neutral! Try to not let emotion get ahold of you.</li>
<li>Research your state laws regarding auto recordings and telephone calls. In some jurisdictions, recording conversations is illegal.</li>
<li>Work with a lawyer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="child-custody-1">Child Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision-making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living together, or even if they never lived together.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>There are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>

<p>Once something is online, or captured in social media, or even via a text, the evidence of it can live forever. It&rsquo;s a consideration we all should take into account, and can play an even bigger role if you are <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">getting divorced</a>.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-and-social-media">Divorce and Social Media</h2>
<p>This fact is something that Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressman, and Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, are dealing with now. You might remember Weiner from his sexting scandal. This last August, Abedin announced she was seeking a legal separation. A following federal investigation into Weiner&rsquo;s digital behavior revealed a number of messages, including some belonging to Ms. Abedin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common story in divorce.  “The problem is, once they’ve already engaged in bad behavior, it’s out there,” said John Slowiaczek, the president-elect of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. “You can’t recapture it, you can’t bury it.”</p>
<p>Regardless of a person&rsquo; technical prowess, it can be difficult to hide our digital behavior. As part of divorce proceedings, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for lawyers to mine public social media profiles as a way of painting a picture of their client&rsquo;s spouses.</p>
<p>And the search doesn&rsquo;t just stop at social media. Lawyers often sift through any data that can be legally obtained as a way of looking for signs of hidden assets or lies. While lawyers typically focus on financial and child custody decisions, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for them to want to paint a vivid picture of the spouse they are going up against.</p>
<p>According to Brook Schaub, a forensic analyst and licensed private investigator at the accounting firm Eide Bailly, a computer “tells you everything about a person’s character.&quot; It has “become the file cabinet, the stationery, the social networking, the everything,” he said.</p>
<p>And that data can become publicly available.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do">What to Do</h2>
<p>If you are facing divorce, there are a number of things you should do to protect your information and privacy. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new email account</li>
<li>stop sharing calendars with your spouse</li>
<li>turn off the ability for apps on their phones to track their locations</li>
<li>change your security questions</li>
<li>be wary of what you post on social media</li>
<li>do not delete photos, texts, or social media - it can be considered destruction of evidence</li>
<li>work with a divorce lawyer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="taking-to-social-media-to-discredit-spouse">Taking to Social Media to Discredit Spouse</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an uncommon practice for exes to take to social media to lash out against their ex-spouses. The practice can feel liberating and freeing but there can be serious consequences for doing so - and not just emotional, but also legal. As the saying goes: If you can&rsquo;t say anything nice, don&rsquo;t say anything at all. This should perhaps be your mantra when it comes to deciding whether or not to diss your ex on social media. Letting it all out on social media can actually lead you right to court for not only libel, but also a heavier judgment in divorce court. &ldquo;You give up so much privacy, and if you don&rsquo;t understand the consequences of it, you can really have problems,&rdquo; says divorce attorney Adam Swickle. &ldquo;The Internet is a dangerous place to comment on your divorce.&rdquo; According to a 2010 survey done by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, 81% of their members agreed that they had seen an increase in the number of cases that involved evidence found on social networks.</p>
<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a huge social networking fan, and also a fan of airing your dirty laundry on the sites, and you&rsquo;re also in the midst of a divorce, there are some things you&rsquo;ll want to consider: , it&rsquo;s important to realize the wider reaching aspect of social media. Sure, posts can be deleted, but they can still live on in people&rsquo;s memories. Would you want your child to read something damning about you? Most likely not, so why damage their relationship with your ex by posting something that is, or maybe isn&rsquo;t even true?</p>

<p>Brad Pitt has finally had a chance to see his children following the announcement of his <a href="https://619divorce.com/">divorce</a> from Angelina Jolie.</p>
<h2 id="brad-pitt-sees-children-for-first-time">Brad Pitt Sees Children for First Time</h2>
<p>of the six children — Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. The super couple will continue to share legal custody. As part of the agreement, the children will reside with Jolie in a California residence. Pitt will be allowed to visit with the children, but only under the supervision of a therapist. The current plan will be in effect until October 20. At that point, the terms of the settlement will be reconsidered. “People from both sides hope that the two sides will reach a longer-term agreement on their own,” an insider explained_._ “The hope is that this period of time will lead them to be able to resolve things without the involvement of the courts.” It has also been reported that Jolie is hoping to eventually work out a c0-parenting relationship with her soon-to-be ex.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is a totally new and different lifestyle, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. This goes for newly divorced parents, as well as parents that have been divorced and co-parenting for years.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully, your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side when scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h2 id="know-how-to-handle-your-child-custody-case">Know How to Handle Your Child Custody Case</h2>

<p>Brad Pitt is facing allegations of child abuse after it was revealed that he got into a physical and verbal altercation with eldest son Maddox.</p>
<h2 id="will-brad-pitt-lose-custody-rights">Will Brad Pitt Lose Custody Rights?</h2>
<p>Following the announcement of the super-couple&rsquo;s <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">divorce</a>, Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s entertainment attorney Robert Offer revealed that she had made her decision to file for divorce “for the health of the family.” Details from Jolie’s filing reveal statements in which she disclosed Pitt’s alleged anger problems and the danger it presented the children the couple shares. Just following that announcement, news hit the internet claiming that Pitt and Maddox, the couple&rsquo;s 15-year-old son had been engaged in a dispute on their private plane as the family traveled from France to Los Angeles. Allegedly, Pitt became upset with Maddox and there was some form of physical or verbal misconduct. While it&rsquo;s unclear if the FBI will decide to investigate, this is not something to be taken lightly as the couple begins divorce and child custody negotiations.</p>
<h2 id="know-how-to-handle-your-child-custody-case">Know How to Handle Your Child Custody Case</h2>

<h2 id="record-everything">Record Everything</h2>
<p>When resolving <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the other parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the other parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the child or children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the other parent</li>
<li>If the other parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the other parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions.

<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>

<p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are keeping their divorce proceedings behind closed doors. There are numerous benefits of following their lead when it comes to working out the terms of your divorce settlement. Because of this, many couples decide that a collaborative divorce is the route for them.</p>
<h2 id="collaborative-divorce">Collaborative Divorce</h2>
<p>. It can also save couples time and money. According to attorney Joryn Jenkins, &ldquo;By the end of the divorce trial, spouses can become enemies. Litigation makes people be mean to each other. … But people usually don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s another option, and lawyers don&rsquo;t tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-collaborative-divorce">What is a Collaborative Divorce?</h2>
<p>A collaborative divorce includes a team of four people: a lawyer for each spouse, a mental health coach, and a financial professional. They all work together to create a divorce agreement which includes alimony, dividing marital property, and child visitation and support. A collaborative divorce is face-to-face while each spouse gives their opinion in order to reach emotional as well as financial and legal solutions. &ldquo;The rewards of collaborative divorce are huge,&rdquo; according to attorney Joryn Jenkins. &ldquo;You learn to work out issues and say things in a better way.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="a-collaborative-divorce-is-shorter-and-costs-less">A Collaborative Divorce is Shorter and Costs Less</h3>
<p>A collaborative divorce may save you both time and money. While a regular divorce that goes to a trial may cost $100,000, the average collaborative divorce is about $32,000. In addition to less money, the average collaborative divorce lasts three to four months to settle compared to a divorce trial that can drag on for years. Because a judge makes the final decision in a trial divorce, there isn&rsquo;t much control when it comes to the process, timing, or outcome of the case. &ldquo;People are raiding their retirement accounts just to pay for divorces,&rdquo; said collaborative attorney Rackham Karlsson. &ldquo;Going to court can be more expensive, more time intensive and corrosive for children.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="collaborative-divorce-a-good-alternative">Collaborative Divorce a Good Alternative</h3>
<p>If a couple can work through their divorce by doing a collaborative divorce compared to a standard one, they save time and money, as well as lots of headaches.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-co-parent">Learning to Co-Parent</h2>
<p>If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be place in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-is-to-set-boundaries">Step Two is to Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the other parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whose scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your therapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with others. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you together and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whereby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhere to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each other ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. There are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Celebrity divorce seems to be in the news every day, whether it&rsquo;s a real <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> or just a rumored one! So when news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s divorce broke this week, it was hard to tell if it was just the rumor mill or truth. Turns out, the super couple commonly referred to as &ldquo;Brangelina&rdquo; is actually getting a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="brangelina-divorce-is-not-a-rumor">Brangelina Divorce is Not a Rumor</h2>
<p>According to the court documents, Angelina Jolie has filed for divorce from husband Brad Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple separated after two years and one month of marriage. The couple married in August 2014 and listed September 15 as their date of separation.</p>
<p>Jolie is seeking physical custody of their six children but has asked the court to grant legal custody to Pitt, meaning he will be able to make decisions for the children as well as have visitation rights. Jolie is also asking to keep &ldquo;miscellaneous jewelry and other personal effects&rdquo; as well as any earnings following the date of their separation. Other separate assets are to be determined later.</p>
<p>Following the announcement Pitt released this statement: &ldquo;I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An attorney for Jolie, Robert Offer, spoke for Jolie, saying &ldquo;This decision was made for the health of the family. She will not be commenting at this time, and asks that the family be given their privacy during this difficult time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But do celebrities really get divorced more often? Or do we just hear about it more because they&rsquo;re in the limelight?</p>
<h2 id="the-hollywood-marriage">The &ldquo;Hollywood Marriage&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hollywood marriage&rdquo; in Hollywood&rsquo;s golden era meant high society marriage between celebrities in the movie industry. Glitz and glamour were the theme of these marriages, but today the term also carries the negative connotation of a short duration marriage ending in either separation or divorce. This negative viewpoint of &ldquo;Hollywood Marriage&rdquo; started to get sour by the 1930&rsquo;s, and hasn&rsquo;t sweetened up much since then.</p>
<h3 id="media-influence-and-celebrity-divorce">Media Influence and Celebrity Divorce</h3>
<p>People and the media are often quick to point their fingers as these failed celebrity marriages, giving the skewed impression that &ldquo;Hollywood Marriages&rdquo; are less successful than non-celebrity marriages. In 1972 Bob Thomas of the Associated Press stated that celebrity marriages that last are usually ignored by the media. For example, Bob and Dolores Hope were married 69 years and Rosalind Russell and Frederick Brisson were married 35 years.</p>
<h3 id="is-the-faults-with-the-celebrities">Is the Faults with the Celebrities</h3>
<p>Even if the media isn&rsquo;t to blame, some believe the fault it part of Hollywood&rsquo;s culture, or perhaps the personal faults of the celebrities themselves. Some think weddings are just used as publicity stunts, whose egotism and celebrity immaturity fuel the culture. With so many opportunities to stray as celebrities work on different projects, high levels of infidelity and promiscuity also fuel the high divorce rates. Bee Wilson of The Daily Telegraph wrote &ldquo;Hollywood marriages&rdquo; often are based on unrealistic dreams and called celebrities &ldquo;permanent children.&rdquo; However, she also indicated that on the counterpoint of his view, classic Hollywood couples such as Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart and Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward were definitely the exception.</p>
<h3 id="opinions-of-celebrities-on-divorce">Opinions of Celebrities on Divorce</h3>
<p>Like everybody else, actors and entertainer also have differing opinions when it comes to the Hollywood divorce rate. Anne Baxter has stated Hollywood is &ldquo;the most difficult place in America for marriage&rdquo; due to the &ldquo;terrible extremes of success and failure&rdquo; the spouses face with their careers. Others feel it&rsquo;s because of the magnifying glass aspect the Hollywood marriages deal with. Mitzi Gaynor said in a 1964 interview, &ldquo;Everything we do is magnified.&rdquo; He also concluded that &ldquo;you have to be a little off-center to get into this business in the first place.&rdquo; This is one reason why celebrities such as Harrison Ford try so hard to keep their private lives private. But in spite of this, he&rsquo;s on his third marriage.</p>
<h3 id="divorce-rate-statistics">Divorce Rate Statistics</h3>
<p>With so many people on scripted television, talk shows, reality shows, etc., the question many people have is who exactly can be considered a &ldquo;celebrity.&rdquo; A Radford University study found &ldquo;dancers and choreographers,&rdquo; perhaps ones like the professional dancers on &ldquo;Dancing With the Stars,&rdquo; currently have the highest divorce rate percentage. &ldquo;Entertainers and performers, sports and related workers, all other&rdquo; come in at above average at tenth. &ldquo;Nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides&rdquo; are ninth and &ldquo;Baggage porters and concierges&rdquo; rake eleventh. A Forbes article concurred with this report, indicating that &ldquo;professional athletes and entertainers&rdquo; combined have a high rate of divorce. One athlete that comes to mind is Tiger Woods and his messy divorce.</p>
<h3 id="potential-celebrity-divorce-reasons">Potential Celebrity Divorce Reasons</h3>
<p>There are many factors involved in a Hollywood divorce, which is why it may seem so commonplace. Some factors include busy schedules that keep the spouses apart for months at a time. As in all marriages, things usually get real, really fast. Instead of a flawless leading man, or picture perfect woman, they suddenly realize they both have flaws, bad breath in the morning, and a few scars here and there, not to mention bad habits like never closing a drawer, leaving the toilet seat up, or picking up after themselves. As a celebrity, temptations are also higher. As an actor, a job requirement is to kiss your other actor in scenes. While they&rsquo;re only stage kisses, the pretend passion frequently become real passion. After a couple of seasons on The Americans, Keri Russell and Matthews Rhys decided to move in together in real life, after she divorced his husband. In addition to on-screen romances turning into off-screen romances, fan is short for &ldquo;fanatic&rdquo; and fans fanatically throw themselves at the object of their affection. The bane of the biggest stars. Elvis had to deal with it and today celebrities like Justin Bieber. With so many people telling you you&rsquo;re wonderful and they love you, its difficult for some to keep their feet on the ground. Why stay with somebody who makes you take the garbage out or do the dishes when you can have somebody who will do it for you instead. Because you&rsquo;re just so incredibly awesome!</p>
<h3 id="general-divorce-rates">General Divorce Rates</h3>
<p>The divorce rate also depends on if it&rsquo;s the first, second, or third marriage, according to the following statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>First marriage divorce rate = 41% - 50%;</li>
<li>Second marriage divorce rate = 60% - 67%;</li>
<li>Third marriage divorce rate = 73% - 74%.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to research, couple who have children have a somewhat lower breakup rate compared to couples who don&rsquo;t have children. Another interesting statistic is that children whose parents were divorced were four times more likely to have their own marriage end in divorce compared to children whose parents remained married.</p>
<h3 id="drop-in-current-divorce-rate">Drop in Current Divorce rate</h3>
<p>Compared to what was previously thought, over the last few decades divorce rates have been dropping. Marriages are lasting longer in the 21st century versus the marriage success rate in the 1990s. As more people decide to follow the newest relationship trend of living together as partners rather than marrying, the divorce rate is expected to continue declining.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-after-i-do---considering-divorce">&ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t&rdquo; After &ldquo;I Do&rdquo; - Considering Divorce</h3>
<p>When people decide to say &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; they never think it may end in &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&rdquo; and divorce. Even once the decision is made, it&rsquo;s hard, and sometimes traumatic, to think about hiring a divorce attorney. Marriage is always difficult, whether you&rsquo;re a normal Joe, or Hollywood A-lister Joe. These are valid reasons for divorce, such as infidelity, but sometimes it just because the couple have just grown apart.

<p>Last year it appeared as if Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez couldn&rsquo;t get <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-high-net-worth-divorce-lawyer/">divorced</a> fast enough. But perhaps the couple as changed their tune?</p>
<h2 id="halle-berry-calling-off-divorce"><strong>Halle Berry Calling Off Divorce</strong></h2>
<p>It appears that the divorce between Halle Berry and estranged husband Olivier Martinez might be dismissed. The two filed last year but have not filed the required paperwork to finalize it. Recently, a divorce court clerk sent a notice to both Halle and Olivier, informing them that case will be dismissed unless further steps are taken. According to sources close to both Halle and Olivier, neither one is in a rush to finalize the divorce. The two are also parents to 3-year-old Maceo and 8-year-old Nahla. </p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge. In the case of the Osbournes, the length of their marriage would undoubtedly make it impossible for them to have their marriage annulled.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez  might have chosen to separate legally while they were determining next steps for their relationship. This is a very common practice when there are children involved. Often times a coupple will seek to &ldquo;make it work,&rdquo; or at least test out the waters of divorce by going through a legal separation. Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact both spouses taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extracurriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mediation-if-you-decide-to-divorce">Mediation if You Decide to Divorce</h2>
<p>Mediation can also be a meaningful experience for couples that have decided to move forward with divorce, but that are also able to work together to come to an agreement. During mediation a couple sits down with a group of trusted advisers, including lawyers and financial advisers. For couples that are able to see eye to eye on the aspects of their marriage, this form of settlement can take less time and less money. Mediation and collaborative law are often effective choices for couples that are able to negotiate on the aspects of their marriage, including child custody and visitation, alimony, and division of marital property. These approaches provide more of a group and team-setting while the spouses sit down with a group of professionals including family law attorneys, financial advisers, and often therapists and other negotiators to come to a decision regarding the divorce agreement. These approaches can often be less litigious and yield a better outcome that satisfies both spouses&rsquo; needs. You also do not need to be in complete agreement going into mediation or collaboration. Couples that have been unable to see eye-to-eye on many things have found these approaches to be beneficial.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">child support and custody</a>, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>Amber Heard received $7 million as part of her <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-high-net-worth-divorce-lawyer/">divorce agreement</a>. Though she had plans to donate the money, in full, to her two favorite charities – the American Civil Liberties Union, with a focus on battling violence against women, and Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Los Angeles - it seems that her ex-husband might be looking to cut her out of the donation picture. Depp has announced plans to essentially &ldquo;avoid the middle man,&rdquo; and donate the settlement money directly to the charities in a series of installments.</p>
<h2 id="depp-might-be-violating-divorce-agreement">Depp Might Be Violating Divorce Agreement</h2>
<p>Following Depp&rsquo;s announcement that he would be donating the money to the charities directly, Heard&rsquo;s legal team responded with a statement saying that while the actress &ldquo;appreciates Johnny Depp&rsquo;s novel interest in supporting two of her favorite charities,&rdquo; his donation would be in violation of the terms of the divorce settlement. &ldquo;If Johnny wishes to change the settlement agreement, we must insist that he honor the full amount by donating $14M to charity, which, after accounting for his tax deduction, is equal to his $7M payment obligation to Amber,&rdquo; the statement continued. In conclusion, &ldquo;Anything less would be a transparent attempt by Johnny&rsquo;s counsel, Laura Wasser and Patti Glaser, to reduce their client&rsquo;s true payment by half under the guise of newfound concern for charities that he has never previously supported. The ACLU has confirmed it has already received the funds from Depp. And according to DeAnn S. Marshall, senior vice president, chief development and marketing officer of the hospital, Children&rsquo;s Hospital Los Angeles &ldquo;has received the first installment and we are grateful to Mr. Depp.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="no-prenup">No Prenup</h2>
<p>As was revealed in court papers, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard did not sign a prenuptial agreement 15 months ago when they got married. And while the idea of signing a prenuptial agreement feels unromantic to most couples, the feelings associated with not signing a prenup, and then facing <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, might be worse.</p>
<h2 id="a-lesson-from-depps-divorce-sign-a-prenup">A Lesson from Depp&rsquo;s Divorce: Sign a Prenup</h2>
<p>Not signing a prenuptial divorce can be a costly mistake - and one that might cost Depp, 52, half of what he owns. Depp&rsquo;s wife of just 15 months, Amber Heard, 30, filed a divorce petition in late May, citing irreconcilable differences, and requesting <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">spousal support</a>. While Depp has denied the request for spousal support, it has been revealed that the couple did not sign a prenuptial agreement. Typically prenups are an important consideration for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>older couples (because they typically have acquired assets);</li>
<li>those who come into a marriage with assets;</li>
<li>people who have children from prior relationships;</li>
<li>people who expect future significant income, such as high-net worth individuals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High Net-Worth Divorce</strong>High Net-Worth Divorce is a unique divorce scenario that involves parties who, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission are situations <em>“in which a natural person who has individual net worth, or joint worth with the person’s spouse, that exceeds $1 million dollars at the time of purchase, excluding the value of the primary residence of such person; or a natural person with an income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year.”</em>  Such a financial situation carries with it specific differences that require the skill of an experienced high net-worth divorce lawyer. With the expertise of a reputable high net-worth attorney you can greater protect your assets and finances from the costly divorce process. <strong>Small Percentage of the Population</strong> , 619 Divorce will provide you with the excellent legal counsel you require for maximizing your success in the courtroom.</p>
<h2 id="prenuptial-agreements-for-everyone">Prenuptial Agreements for Everyone</h2>
<p>But prenups aren&rsquo;t just for the super rich. As Joslin Davis, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, explains, creating a prenuptial agreement — or for unmarried couples, a cohabitation agreement — can make sense for many people. &ldquo;It requires people to think ahead,&rdquo; she said. Young couples can also benefit from the creation of a prenuptial agreement because it provides them a chance to plan out issues like paying off one partner&rsquo;s student-loan debt, or compensation for leaving the workforce to care for their future children.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-mistakes-in-a-prenuptial-agreement">Avoid Mistakes in a Prenuptial Agreement</h3>
<p>If there are mistakes in a prenuptial agreement it can be declared invalid, which can cause much greater headaches should your marriage turn to divorce. Some common mistakes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same Legal Representation – Both spouses need separate attorneys to ensure each understands the prenuptial agreement independently of the other. This ensures the signing of the final prenuptial agreement is voluntary, without one spouse feeling as if they are being pressured into signing it.</li>
<li>Signed Under Duress – If one party feels pressured into signing the prenuptial agreement, or if they were influenced by drugs or alcohol affecting their mental capacity, it can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Signed Too Soon Before the Wedding - Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to sign the prenuptial agreement. If the couple divorces soon after the wedding, an argument that one party was coerced into signing can be argued. The prenuptial agreement should be signed one to three months before the wedding to give the spouse sufficient time to think about and consider what they are signing.</li>
<li>No Full Disclosure – Make sure the prenuptial agreement discloses all assets and debts.</li>
<li>Child Support Provisions – Do not include child custody or support. If the couple divorces and children are involved, the court will rule in whatever is the best interests of the child and not what was in the prenuptial agreement. If child custody and support are included the whole prenuptial agreement can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Biased - If the prenuptial agreement seems biased towards one spouse party, it can be decided it&rsquo;s unenforceable or “unconscionable.”</li>
<li>Unenforceable Provisions – If a prenuptial agreement has unusual provisions, such as who does the dishes or takes out the garbage, they can be deemed unenforceable, which will weaken it.</li>
<li>Oral Agreement – A prenuptial agreement should be in written and multiple copies made. Each spouse and spouse&rsquo;s attorney should have a copy of the prenuptial agreement.</li>
<li>Ambiguous Writing – If anything is unclear, or there is ambiguous wording, the prenuptial agreement can be challenged in court.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marital-property-division">Marital Property Division</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to do everything you can to protect yourself financially. Doing so means completely understanding <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhabited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the higher wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. You&rsquo;ll want to work with a divorce attorney in the state in which you are divorcing so they can help advise you on your state&rsquo;s specific laws regarding property division.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>

<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">Divorce</a> is not only a difficult time in a person&rsquo;s life, but it can also be emotionally traumatic. The relationship with your spouse and the structure of your lives that you helped establish in what you thought would be a happily-ever-after marriage has ended. What are the next steps and the things that will help you get back that feeling you call &ldquo;normal&rdquo;? Although you may not realize it, thise are some things you can do to get back thise.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-is-a-lot-like-death">Divorce is a Lot Like Death</h2>
<p>Natalie Greggs, a family law attorney from Allen, Texas, likens divorce to death. Divorce is comparable to physical loss with the stress and grief of losing your marriage partner through divorce. It&rsquo;s like a 1-2 punch. One punch hitting you physically, the second punch hitting you emotionally. Gregg advises his clients, &ldquo;Imagine how you&rsquo;re going to react to this death, and how it&rsquo;s going to impact every part of your body - your mind, your stomach, even your ability to walk.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s definitely not something you can easily move on from, but thise is something you can focus on that may help. Something called &ldquo;Self-Care&rdquo;! Taking care of yourself.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-self-care">Why Do Self-Care?</h3>
<p>According to Gregg, “Self-care is the number one thing that gets you through the day.” Though she is a family law attorney, and not a thisapist, she advises clients that self-care is the best method to get them through this rough time.</p>
<h3 id="self-care-is-future-well-being">Self-Care is Future Well-Being</h3>
<p>Self-care is more than just a way to get through each day while you go through your divorce. Self-care is also crucial for the well-being of your future as well. Numerous studies indicate that stress is a cause of long-term health problems. Research also indicates that individuals going through a divorce has a heightened risk for some long-term chronic health problems. This research is even more scarier when faced with the fact that experts mention that 40-50% of all marriages end in divorce.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-sane-during-your-divorce">Keeping Sane During Your Divorce</h3>
<p>Hise are some self-care tips to practice while you go through a divorce: <strong>Exercise.</strong> Gregg advises, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not on a regular exercise routine, get on one. You don&rsquo;t have to belong to a gym. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything fancy. Just take a walk every day.&rdquo;  Even if you&rsquo;re not going through a divorce, exercise is good for you. For people going through traumatic times, it is especially helpful. Exercise encourages your body to produce endorphins, a feel-good chemical for the brain. Certified integrative nutrition coach and personal trainer Lindsay Hunt, says exercise also helps increase self-confidence, improves sleep, reduces anxiety symptoms, and reduces stress and depression. Any form involving physical movement is helpful such as walking, dancing, swimming, and yoga. The trick is to find something you really enjoy doing. That way chances are you&rsquo;ll want to keep doing it often and on a regular basis. Anothis tip is to find a friend or &ldquo;workout buddy&rdquo; to help encourage you to get off that couch and get moving. They can also encourage you be holding you accountable for getting up and out. <strong>Change Your Diet Up.</strong> When people are faced with emotional issues it can cause you to lose and/or gain weight. Divorce can increase these ups and down, making them go out of control. You can go from one extreme to anothis, from completely restricting meals to binging on unhealthy foods. &ldquo;I had a slender client who, over the course of a year, proceeded to lose probably 50 pounds,&rdquo; remembers Greggs. &ldquo;By the end of his case, she was skeletal.&rdquo; While some may lose weight, othiss can gain. Mikki Meyer, a licensed marriage and family thisapist, said she had a client who ended up gaining almost 100 pounds. Hunt suggests trying to be proactive and pre-emptive about both diet as well as divorce. Diet has a big part in affecting your mood, which is important during a divorce. Hunt reveals, &ldquo;Eating the right foods may ease depression and calm anxiety.&rdquo; He recommends eating three meals a day consisting of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Having a variety like this helps keep blood sugar levels stable as well as helping to prevent dips leading to cravings. Studies also show that diets high in antioxidants help with depression. So fill that plate high with fruit and veggies. When changing your diet it&rsquo;s best to try avoiding sugar, salty foods, artificial ingredients, excessive caffeine consumption, and especially alcohol. According to studies, dehydration tends to increase stress hormone levels. Because of this, Hunt recommends drinking lots of water.</p>
<h3 id="more-healthy-foods-for-your-brain">More Healthy Foods for Your Brain</h3>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty wild fish such as salmon, and nuts, can help brain function and improves your mood. Steel-cut oatmeal also adds serotonin-boosting complex carbohydrates. It is also a comfort food. If you seem to have trouble eating, you might think about drinking your nutrition. You can make bone broth into a soup that&rsquo;s filled with minerals like magnesium. Your body can easily absorb and helps promotes healthy digestion for upset stomachs. Anothis way to get nutrition if you have trouble eating is protein shakes. Green vegetable juices are also a good source of nutrition. You can also try taking smaller bites of protein and healthy fats such as eggs, nuts, and avocados. This will help you so you don&rsquo;t lose too much weight. According to Hunt, &ldquo;It is important to feed your body even if you are not hungry, as our immune systems become extremely vulnerable and weak during times of sadness and stress. Finding foods that are comforting and easy to get down is important for your health.&rdquo; <strong>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s hard to return to a normal schedule, it&rsquo;s important to try. Greggs says, &ldquo;Consistency is important for your emotional health. Show up to work on time. Have your routine. Make [yourself] and your children go to bed when you usually go to bed. Don’t act like the divorce is ending your life.&rdquo; <strong>Get Sunshine.</strong> Sunlight boosts vitamin D which your body needs for natural processes and for increasing serotonin levels. Hunt advises, &ldquo;Aim for sunlight every day.&rdquo; Studies indicate at least 15 minutes every day is helpful. <strong>Be Preventative whise Your Health is Concerned.</strong> Sociology Professor and director of the Population Research Center Mark Hayward, from the University of Texas—Austin, has researched the long-term health affects and discovered stress from divorce accelerates biological processes that can lead to cardiovascular disease. He has found that divorced, middle-aged women tend to be more likely to develop heart disease compared with non-divorced, middle-aged married women.  503-3050</p>

<p>While it appeared earlier this summer that Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne&rsquo;s 33-year-marriage was headed towards <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, it now appears that the couple has decided to reconcile.</p>
<h2 id="sharon-and-ozzy-reconcile">Sharon and Ozzy Reconcile</h2>
<p>On Monday, July 25, Ozzy spoke to <em>Good Morning America</em> about his side of things. He noted that things were &ldquo;back on track again&rdquo; after &ldquo;drifting apart for a while &hellip; you get back on the horse.&rdquo; Sharon voiced her take on Ozzy&rsquo;s statements on her talk show <em>The Talk</em>, saying: &ldquo;Um, &lsquo;Get back on the horse,&rsquo; how dare you? He&rsquo;s such a romantic fool. So romantic back on. It&rsquo;s been very hard.&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very embarrassed and ashamed about his conduct,&rdquo; she went on to say. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak for him. But for me, um, yes, you know. I forgive. It&rsquo;s going to take a long time to trust but you know we&rsquo;ve been together for 36 years, 34 of marriage, and it&rsquo;s more than half of my life.&rdquo; While the two may differ on how they are approaching the reconciliation, it appears that the divorce is off.</p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge. In the case of the Osbournes, the length of their marriage would undoubtedly make it impossible for them to have their marriage annulled.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>The Osbournes might have chosen to separate legally while they were determining next steps for their relationship. Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mediation-if-you-decide-to-divorce">Mediation if You Decide to Divorce</h2>
<p>Mediation can also be a meaningful experience for couples that have decided to move forward with divorce, but that are also able to work together to come to an agreement. During mediation a couple sits down with a group of trusted advisers, including lawyers and financial advisers. For couples that are able to see eye to eye on the aspects of their marriage, this form of settlement can take less time and less money. Mediation and collaborative law are often effective choices for couples that are able to negotiate on the aspects of their marriage, including child custody and visitation, alimony, and division of marital property. These approaches provide more of a group and team-setting while the spouses sit down with a group of professionals including family law attorneys, financial advisers, and often therapists and other negotiators to come to a decision regarding the divorce agreement. These approaches can often be less litigious and yield a better outcome that satisfies both spouses&rsquo; needs. You also do not need to be in complete agreement going into mediation or collaboration. Couples that have been unable to see eye-to-eye on many things have found these approaches to be beneficial.</p>

<p>Former NFL player Ed Hartwell has <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">filed for divorce</a> from actress Keshia Knight Pulliam according to court papers filed in Georgia on July 25. Hartwell cited irreconcilable differences. The two have only been married for seven months.</p>
<h2 id="hartwell-files-divorce-papers">Hartwell Files Divorce Papers</h2>
<p>The <em>Cosby Show</em> alum Pulliam, 37, and Hartwell secretly tied the knot during a New Year&rsquo;s Eve ceremony in January at their Georgia home. &ldquo;We did it literally in our living room in our home,&rdquo; announced Pulliam on her podcast, Kandidly Keshia, at the end of January. &ldquo;We come from large families. I&rsquo;m one of four, Ed is one of six. We invited people. They had no clue they were coming to a wedding. They thought they were coming to a New Year&rsquo;s party.&rdquo; Considering that Hartwell and Pulliam have been married for such a short time, they might be eligible for annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>An annulment dissolves a marriage just as a divorce does. But an annulment essentially states that there never was a valid marriage. Just as there are grounds for divorce, thise are also specific grounds for annulments to be granted. Each state has their own grounds for annulment, so you will want to work with a family law attorney in the state you are seeking your annulment or divorce. The following are typical statutory grounds for granting an annulment:</p>
<ul>
<li>fraud</li>
<li>duress or force</li>
<li>bigamy</li>
<li>underage during the time of the marriage</li>
<li>intoxication</li>
<li>mental incapacity</li>
<li>insanity</li>
<li>impotence</li>
<li>concealed divorce</li>
<li>too close a kinship (consanguinity)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, thise are procedures that must be followed if you are seeking an annulment. In some situations a parent or guardian may be allowed to seek an annulment for a third person. Each state has different residency requirements. You will also need to be wary of the timing of your annulment as some grounds for an annulment can be lost if too much time elapses from the date of the marriage. Children born during the course of the marriage are typically treated like children in a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation is a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a separation while still remaining legally married. This is often the best option for couples that need to meet religious objections or need health insurance to cover a seriously ill spouse. A court is able to award &ldquo;separate maintenance&rdquo; as part of a legal separation. This is the equivalent of alimony and child support. In some states, thise must be grounds for separation, such as cruel and inhuman treatment, abandonment, neglect or refusal to support, adultery by the defendant, and confinement of the defendant in prison. Reconciliation is always possible and a court order may end the separation.</p>
<h2 id="grounds-for-divorce">Grounds for Divorce</h2>
<p>, and any remaining waiting period before the divorce is final. In California this waiting time is 6 months and a day. That is how long it takes for your legal status to be changed from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to &ldquo;single.&rdquo; In a no-fault state, neithis party is &ldquo;blamed&rdquo; for the end of the marriage, and typically couples choose &ldquo;irreconcilable differences,&rdquo; meaning that they are unable to make the marriage work, and will never be able to make the marriage work.  All states have some form of no-fault divorce, using words such as &ldquo;incompatibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;insupportability,&rdquo; or &ldquo;irreconcilable differences as reasons. Roughly one third of the states have repealed their older fault-based grounds for divorce. Several states also allow marrying couples to create a &ldquo;Covenant Marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="what-is-covenant-marriage">What is Covenant Marriage?</h3>
<p>Covenant marriages require the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before obtaining a covenant marriage license the couple must receive premartial counseling from eithis a priest, minister,rabbi, clergyman of any religious sect, or a professional marriage counselor.</li>
<li>The couple must legally agree to seek marital counseling if problems develop during the marriage.</li>
<li>The couple can only seek a divorce or legal separation for limited reasons, such as: adultery, the committing a felony with a sentence of imprisonment at hard labor or death, abandonment, physical or sexual abuse, habitual intemperance (for example,alcohol or drug abuse), cruel treatment, or severe ill treatment by the othis spouse. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Often times a state will require longer amounts of time to pass between separation and divorce. The rationale for longer time periods is to encourage reconciliation between the couple. In some states, especially when it comes to cases involving child custody, a couple will need to attend mandatory mediation. The <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">mediation</a> process is confidential, can be less adversarial, and is often less expensive than standard courtroom proceedings. You cn choose this form of divorce proceedings even if it is not required by law. <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">Collaborative divorce</a> is also a possibility for parties to obtain a dissolution of marriage.</p>
<h2 id="hartwell-might-be-disputing-paternity">Hartwell Might be Disputing Paternity</h2>
<p>Just a week before filing for divorce, Pulliam announced that the couple was pregnant via her Instagram. She captioned the photo of the baby bump with &ldquo;Surprise!!! We have a new addition coming soon&hellip; Tune into #KandidlyKeshia this week for the details!!&rdquo; But it seems that Hartwell might doubt he is the father. As he told TheYBF.com via a rep, &ldquo;Right now, the only thing I want is a paternity test for the baby.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="paternity">Paternity</h2>
<p>Either parent is able to dispute <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/" title="San Diego Paternity Lawyer">paternity</a>. Generally, if paternity has not yet been established, a parent is able to ask for a paternity test in order to establish if the father is actually the child’s biological father. Under California law, the word &ldquo;paternity&rdquo; is used interchangeably with &ldquo;parentage&rdquo; and &ldquo;parental relationship.&rdquo; Laws regarding paternity are complicated. For example, if a court order has already determined someone is the fathis of the child, and he or the mothis of the child wants genetic (DNA) testing, it might be too late to do so, due to the court order. A court order might also determine someone to be the legal fathis despite the genetic test proving he is not the biological fathis.</p>
<h3 id="paternity-assumption">Paternity Assumption</h3>
<p>Establishing paternity means eithis the courts or parents of the child have determined who the fathis is. The law assumes paternity under these instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>the husband of the mothis is presumed to be the child&rsquo;s fathis when the child is born during a marriage.</li>
<li>if a man has been living with the child and the mothis in a &ldquo;family-like&rdquo; manner, the man has demonstrated he is committed to the child, and even if he is not the biological fathis, he is still presumed to be the child&rsquo;s fathis.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these two things are not the case, then paternity needs to be established.</p>
<h3 id="paternity-testing">Paternity Testing</h3>
<p>Establishing paternity is helpful when it comes to providing financial support and health insurance for the child. it&rsquo;s also important to establish paternity if thise are ever legal issues surrounding child support and child visitation. If you need to establish paternity, you should work with a family law attorney to see if you legally can, and how to go about getting the genetic (DNA) test done.

<p>For months tabloids speculated that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner&rsquo;s marriage was headed towards divorce. But now, according to sources close to the couple, it looks like they might not be <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorcing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-statement">Divorce Statement</h2>
<p>Just a year ago a statement released by the couple&rsquo;s rep, Affleck, 42, and Garner, 43, noted: “After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce. We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children, whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter.” The family flew to the Bahamas to seemingly try to stay out of the public&rsquo;s eye while they worked out the details of the divorce. But it appears that all that might be on hold.</p>
<h2 id="the-making-of-bennifer">The Making of &ldquo;Bennifer&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The two met on the set of &ldquo;Pearl Harbor&rdquo; in 2001 and then co-starred in &ldquo;Daredevil,&rdquo; which was released in 2003. &ldquo;That’s whise I found my wife,&rdquo; Affleck said during a <em>Playboy</em> magazine interview. &ldquo;We met on Pearl Harbor, which people hated, but we fell in love on &lsquo;Daredevil.&rsquo;&rdquo; They were married during a private ceremony in Turks and Caicos in 2005. During the wedding, Garner was four months pregnant with their daughter Violet.  The two share three children: Violet, 9, Seraphina, 6, and Samuel, 3. According to sources close to the couple, &ldquo;They have both been very open about their marriage struggles,&rdquo; and the split &ldquo;was inevitable. If there&rsquo;s any surprise, it&rsquo;s how long it took to happen.&rdquo; But maybe not. In new information revealed by a source, a few weeks ago, things changed, and “It does not seem to be moving in that direction. We can only speculate on what might happen to the couple, but it&rsquo;s not uncommon couples to call off divorces.</p>
<h3 id="not-uncommon">Not Uncommon</h3>
<p>While it may seem that calling off a divorce is a rarity, it&rsquo;s something that happens quite often. For couples thinking about divorce, who are still un-sure, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there are other options to consider.</p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>

How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts.

You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mediation-if-you-decide-to-divorce">Mediation if You Decide to Divorce</h2>
<p>Mediation can also be a meaningful experience for couples that have decided to move forward with divorce, but that are also able to work together to come to an agreement. During mediation a couple sits down with a group of trusted advisers, including lawyers and financial advisers. For couples that are able to see eye to eye on the aspects of their marriage, this form of settlement can take less time and less money.  Mediation and collaborative law are often effective choices for couples that are able to negotiate on the aspects of their marriage, including child custody and visitation, alimony, and division of marital property. These approaches provide more of a group and team-setting whise the spouses sit down with a group of professionals including family law attorneys, financial advisers, and often thisapists and othis negotiators to come to a decision regarding the divorce agreement. These approaches can often be less litigious and yield a better outcome that satisfies both spouses&rsquo; needs. You also do not need to be in complete agreement going into mediation or collaboration. Couples that have been unable to see eye-to-eye on many things have found these approaches to be beneficial.</p>
<h2 id="bennifer-still-co-parents">Bennifer Still Co-Parents</h2>
<p>In an interview with <em>Yahoo! Parenting</em> Garner spoke about how children changed the couple&rsquo;s marriage: &ldquo;You just go on a ride together because you don’t know who you’re going to be when you first have a baby and you don’t know who [your partner] is going to be. You have to just hang in thise while you figure it out &ndash; and have a lot of patience for each othis.&rdquo; Garner spoke of the way children changed their marriage again in a <em>InStyle</em> magazine interview. &ldquo;When we had our first [child], we had only been togethis a year. We were babies. It happened so fast, I hardly remember what we were like before the kids got hise.&rdquo; He also went on to say she and Affleck had a &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; marriage. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to be courted all the time, and I don&rsquo;t want to court him right now; I don&rsquo;t have the energy!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re definitely in a very mindful place whise we&rsquo;re making an effort to be togethis, do things at the same time, and be loving.&rdquo; It seems the two were realistic about marriage and that it requires both spouses to put in effort and work. When Affleck accepted his best picture Oscar in 2013 for the movie he directed, <em>Argo,</em> he thanked his wife for &ldquo;working on our marriage,&rdquo; adding &ldquo;thise&rsquo;s no one I&rsquo;d rathis work with.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="parentingabilities">Parenting Abilities</h2>
<p>Garner has said this of their parenting abilities: &ldquo;For better or worse, I tend to be the one who says, &lsquo;This is what needs to happen.&rsquo; I know who wants what lunch, and I&rsquo;ve done all the school paperwork and filled out the emergency cards. Ben doesn&rsquo;t know that stuff exists,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is in charge of laughter. No matter how much I tickle them or toss them or chase them around, it&rsquo;s not the same. If I&rsquo;m the slow, steady drumbeat, he&rsquo;s the jazz.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>While it seems the two will have no problem co-parenting, it can still be a tough situation to work through. Both parents need to adjust their schedules so that the best interests of the children can be served. In a situation whise a couple is unable to find a co-parenting schedule that works, it is often left to a judge to decide and work out a schedule. Typically, co-parenting schedules are part of the divorce agreement, and in cases whise a couple has decided to use a mediation approach, co-parenting schedules are typically ones that work for both couples.</p>

<p>As was revealed in court papers, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard did not sign a prenuptial agreement 15 months ago when they got married. And while the idea of signing a prenuptial agreement feels unromantic to most couples, the feelings associated with not signing a prenup, and then facing <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, might be worse.</p>
<h2 id="a-lesson-from-depps-divorce-sign-a-prenup">A Lesson from Depp&rsquo;s Divorce: Sign a Prenup</h2>
<p>Not signing a prenuptial divorce can be a costly mistake - and one that might cost Depp, 52, half of what he owns. Depp&rsquo;s wife of just 15 months, Amber Heard, 30, filed a divorce petition in late May, citing irreconcilable differences, and requesting <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">spousal support</a>. While Depp has denied the request for spousal support, it has been revealed that the couple did not sign a prenuptial agreement. Typically prenups are an important consideration for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>older couples (because they typically have acquired assets);</li>
<li>those who come into a marriage with assets;</li>
<li>people who have children from prior relationships;</li>
<li>people who expect future significant income, such as high-net worth individuals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High Net-Worth Divorce</strong>High Net-Worth Divorce is a unique divorce scenario that involves parties who, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission are situations <em>“in which a natural person who has individual net worth, or joint worth with the person’s spouse, that exceeds $1 million dollars at the time of purchase, excluding the value of the primary residence of such person; or a natural person with an income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year.”</em>  Such a financial situation carries with it specific differences that require the skill of an experienced high net-worth divorce lawyer. With the expertise of a reputable high net-worth attorney you can greater protect your assets and finances from the costly divorce process. <strong>Small Percentage of the Population</strong> , 619 Divorce will provide you with the excellent legal counsel you require for maximizing your success in the courtroom.</p>
<h2 id="prenuptial-agreements-for-everyone">Prenuptial Agreements for Everyone</h2>
<p>But prenups aren&rsquo;t just for the super rich. As Joslin Davis, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, explains, creating a prenuptial agreement — or for unmarried couples, a cohabitation agreement — can make sense for many people. &ldquo;It requires people to think ahead,&rdquo; she said. Young couples can also benefit from the creation of a prenuptial agreement because it provides them a chance to plan out issues like paying off one partner&rsquo;s student-loan debt, or compensation for leaving the workforce to care for their future children.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-mistakes-in-a-prenuptial-agreement">Avoid Mistakes in a Prenuptial Agreement</h3>
<p>If there are mistakes in a prenuptial agreement it can be declared invalid, which can cause much greater headaches should your marriage turn to divorce. Some common mistakes include:</p>

<li>Same Legal Representation – Both spouses need separate attorneys to ensure each understands the prenuptial agreement independently of the other. This ensures the signing of the final prenuptial agreement is voluntary, without one spouse feeling as if they are being pressured into signing it.</li>
<li>Signed Under Duress – If one party feels pressured into signing the prenuptial agreement, or if they were influenced by drugs or alcohol affecting their mental capacity, it can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Signed Too Soon Before the Wedding - Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to sign the prenuptial agreement. If the couple divorces soon after the wedding, an argument that one party was coerced into signing can be argued. The prenuptial agreement should be signed one to three months before the wedding to give the spouse sufficient time to think about and consider what they are signing.</li>
<li>No Full Disclosure – Make sure the prenuptial agreement discloses all assets and debts.</li>
<li>Child Support Provisions – Do not include child custody or support. If the couple divorces and children are involved, the court will rule in whatever is the best interests of the child and not what was in the prenuptial agreement. If child custody and support are included the whole prenuptial agreement can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Biased - If the prenuptial agreement seems biased towards one spouse party, it can be decided it&rsquo;s unenforceable or “unconscionable.”</li>
<li>Unenforceable Provisions – If a prenuptial agreement has unusual provisions, such as who does the dishes or takes out the garbage, they can be deemed unenforceable, which will weaken it.</li>
<li>Oral Agreement – A prenuptial agreement should be in written and multiple copies made. Each spouse and spouse&rsquo;s attorney should have a copy of the prenuptial agreement.</li>
<li>Ambiguous Writing – If anything is unclear, or there is ambiguous wording, the prenuptial agreement can be challenged in court.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marital-property-division">Marital Property Division</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to do everything you can to protect yourself financially. Doing so means completely understanding <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhabited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the higher wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. You&rsquo;ll want to work with a divorce attorney in the state in which you are divorcing so they can help advise you on your state&rsquo;s specific laws regarding property division.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various other means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>

<p>Just after <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-high-net-worth-divorce-lawyer/">filing for divorce</a> from Johnny Depp, Amber Heard has sought a restraining order against the Pirates of the Caribbean actor.</p>
<h2 id="amber-heard-files-restraining-order-against-depp">Amber Heard Files Restraining Order Against Depp</h2>
<p>Heard is cited irreconcilable differences and requested spousal support, according to court papers. The official separation date was May 22. It now appears that Heard has also filed a restraining order request against Depp, claiming that the actor had been violent towards her over the course of their 15-month marriage.</p>
<h2 id="the-romance">The Romance</h2>
<p>The two met on the set of <em>The Rum Diary</em> in 2009 and were married in February 2015 in two separate ceremonies - one at Depp&rsquo;s West Hollywood, California, home and one on his private island in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Last November, Heard dispelled rumors that the couple was having marital issues, telling <em>Marie Claire</em> during an interview, &ldquo;I try not to react to the horrible misrepresentation of our lives, but it is strange and hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, during his acceptance speech at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, Depp said, &ldquo;I also have to thank my wife, Amber, for putting up with me. For living with all these characters, which can&rsquo;t be easy. It&rsquo;s hard for me, it&rsquo;s gotta be hard for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During a recent junket for <em>The Adderall Diaries</em>, Heard discussed how important her privacy is to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, in my life, the most precious thing I can have is my privacy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any reason or desire to [share], but I understand why people do and why they would. A lot of people find ways to do it for good and control their representation of themselves, which I think actors or celebrities typically have not had control over for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="depps-lawyers-skeptical">Depp&rsquo;s Lawyers Skeptical</h2>
<p>While Heard might have filed for a restraining order, Depp’s attorney isn&rsquo;t buying it and feels Heard is “attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.”  Depp&rsquo;s attorney went on to say that “as a successful actress with significant income of her own, there is no question Amber can support herself” until both actors “have had a reasonable amount of time to assess their finances” with their attorneys to negotiate a “mutually agreeable resolution.”</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the process of getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, looking for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">spousal support</a>, or anticipate paying spousal support, you need to understand some important things. As always, it&rsquo;s advised that you work with a family law attorney that can provide you with specifics about your situation.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-spousal-support">What is Spousal Support?</h2>
<p>Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intenced to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to anothis.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In othis words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must proved your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whethis you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determinig spousal support, the court usually requires the highis earner, whethis they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-financial-situation-changes-affect-spousal-support">How do Financial Situation Changes Affect Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The length of spousal support payments could also depend on whether the spouse who is getting the support has any changes in their financial situation, such as starting a new job or getting a raise. The purpose for spousal support is to make sure the spouse receiving it has financial safeguards. If the spouse receiving support doesn&rsquo;t need it anymore in order to maintain their financial stability, the court may decide that they no longer need the spousal support they are receiving.</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support-in-high-net-worth-divorces">Spousal Support in High Net-Worth Divorces</h2>
<p>Because both Depp and Heard are well-paid actors, their divorce is an example of a high net-worth divorce. High Net-Worth Divorce is a unique divorce scenario that involves parties who, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission are situations <em>“in which a natural person who has individual net worth, or joint worth with the person’s spouse, that exceeds $1 million dollars at the time of purchase, excluding the value of the primary residence of such person; or a natural person with an income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year.”</em>  Such a financial situation carries with it specific differences that require the skill of an experienced high net-worth divorce lawyer. With the expertise of a reputable high net-worth attorney you can greater protect your assets and finances from the costly divorce process. In addition to their high net-worth divorce, Heard and Depp did not sign a prenuptial agreement. It&rsquo;s always advised that you sign a prenuptial agreement, regardless of the income levels of each spouse.</p>
<h3 id="prenuptial-agreements">Prenuptial Agreements</h3>
<p>While Depp and Heard&rsquo;s number one failure is not signing a prenuptial agreement, there are also mistakes that can be made when you do sign a <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">prenuptial agreement</a>. If there are mistakes in a prenuptial agreement it can be declared invalid. Some common mistakes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same Legal Representation – Both spouses need separate attorneys to ensure each understands the prenuptial agreement independently of the othis. This ensures the signing of the final prenuptial agreement is voluntary, without one spouse feeling as if they are being pressured into signing it.</li>

<p>An Italian judge has ruled that it is not a crime that a man from Padua, Italy paid his s<a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">pousal support</a> in pizza.</p>
<h2 id="not-a-crime-to-pay-spousal-support-in-pizza">Not a Crime to Pay Spousal Support in Pizza</h2>
<p>“In lieu of money, the defendant offered his ex-wife the same amount of compensation in the form of take-away pizzas from his workplace, an offer promptly rejected as “beggar’s change,” wrote Italian judge Chiara Bitozzi in her ruling. Chef Nicola Toso divorced his wife Nicoletta Zuin in 2002. As part of their divorce agreement, Toso agreed to pay about $335 in <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">monthly support payments.</a> When his restaurant business took a major financial hit in Italy&rsquo;s 2008 crisis, he did what he could, and offered to pay his ex-wife in the only way he could - with food from his restaurant, including pizza. From 2008 to 2010, Toso provided food to his ex-wife instead of the agreed-upon currency that was in their initial divorce agreement. Then Zuin decided in 2010 that this was not satisfactory and took her ex-husband to court, citing the fact that he was unable to provide alimony. Toso&rsquo;s attorney argued that since Toso had fallen on hard times, he did what he could and was able to successfully fulfill all other custody obligations. Judge Bitozzi agreed, and went on to rule that no crime had been committed.</p>

<h3 id="tax-strategy">Tax Strategy</h3>
<p>If you are receiving spousal support is that you have to declare it as income on your taxes.  agreements, you have to remember this rule since it impacts the bottom line of your finances. The decision and ruling reflects your intentions when it&rsquo;s time to do your taxes. For example, you may decide that the spouse who is paying the spousal support should agree to pay the tax liability of the spouse who is receiving the spousal support. You should discuss this with your family law attorney during the hearing for your spousal support determination. If you&rsquo;re still on good terms with your spouse, it would be helpful to discuss and decide on the best tax deal that would work for you both. If you&rsquo;re not on good times, this might be difficult to come to a mutual tax deal decision, but if you can manage come to a mutual agreement it will save both of you lots of time and headaches when it&rsquo;s tax season. If you get spousal support you should prepare for a potential impace when tax time comes. Your ex isn&rsquo;t able to withhold income taxes from your support checks, which means you have to account for the taxes when you file your tax return. Because of this you may want to consider paying taxes on a quarterly basis, which will save you from being hit with a big tax liability when April 15th comes around. If you&rsquo;re paying spousal support remember you can deduct the payments on your income taxes. However, you can&rsquo;t deduct child support or any property distribution. The IRS frequently scrutinizes spousal support payments for the first three years you make the payments. This is to make sure that you&rsquo;re not disguising the spousal support payments as property distribution or something else related to your divorce. A divorce attorney understands all the ins and outs of tax issues relating to divorce, and can help you understand the issues during the spousal support hearings and afterward, after you begin to make the payments.</p>
<h2 id="prenuptial-agreement">Prenuptial Agreement</h2>
<p>Often times the issue of spousal support is written into a prenuptial agreement. This is actually a standard part of a prenuptial agreement, and one that you&rsquo;ll want to include when drafting an agreement. While prenuptial agreements are often associated with celebrity couples such as Cuoco and Sweeting, they&rsquo;re not just meant for high-income families. In fact, any couple should consider signing a prenuptial agreement, especially those who bring personal or business assets to the marriage.  The most basic of these prenuptial contracts provide a list of premarital assets that will need to be decided upon should the marriage end in divorce. They can save a lot of headaches further down the line.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-be-included">What Can Be Included</h3>
<p>There are a number of things that can be included on a prenuptial agreement, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of marital and community property</li>
<li>Protection from each others debts - you are able to use a prenup to limit your liability for each other&rsquo;s debts.</li>
<li>Provisions for children from previous marriages</li>
<li>If you want to keep property in your birth family</li>

<p>This time around, it appears that the <a href="https://619divorce.com/">divorce</a> will be finalized for Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom.</p>
<h2 id="the-continuation-of-the-kardashian-and-odom-divorce-proceedings">The Continuation of the Kardashian and Odom Divorce Proceedings</h2>
<p>The reality TV star and former professional basketball player married in September 2009, just weeks after first meeting. But after Odom&rsquo;s, 35, months of alleged drug use and infidelity, Kardashian, 31, decided to call it quits. Legal documents show the divorce, officially filed on July 21, was &ldquo;based in irreconcilable differences,&rdquo; and that Kardashian asked that his name be restored to Khloe Kardashian.</p>
<p>While Kardashian might have initiated the divorce papers over a year ago, the divorce was put on hold because Odom could not be located. Odom was then discovered unconscious in a brothel. Kardashian rushed to his side and remained there day and night, ensuring he received the best medical treatment possible.</p>
<p>Now that Odom has recovered, it appears that Kardashian has reinstated the divorce papers.</p>
<p>According to a source, it ”was always the plan&quot; to go through with the split. &ldquo;The divorce has never been officially off. Khloé was waiting for the timing to be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Kardashian seems to be happier than ever. Just following the reinstatement of the divorce papers, Kardashian was in attendance at her sister’s ex Scott Disick’s birthday party. &ldquo;She was really in a great mood. Very bubbly and happy,&rdquo; said a source at the party. &ldquo;She played with her nieces and nephews. She is the best aunt.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;She took care of Lamar out of love, but she is ready to move on now,&rdquo; said a source, explaining how Kardashian took care of Odom not only emotionally, but also financially following his brothel incident. The source also went on to add that Kardashian &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t agree&rdquo; with recent incidents of Odom’s drinking.</p>
<h2 id="cant-find-spouse">Can&rsquo;t Find Spouse</h2>
<p>One of the issues Kardashian ran into during the initial filing was the fact that she could not locate Odom. It&rsquo;s an issue that people run into quite commonly during the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce process</a>. As a result, there have been legal actions put in place to help people who want to continue with a divorce even if they cannot locate their spouse.  In situations such as this, it&rsquo;s frequently common to publicly declare the divorce.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-of-serving-divorce-papers">Difficulty of Serving Divorce Papers</h3>
<p>The purpose of divorce papers being served on your spouse is to let them know a petition for divorce was filed. The paperwork also tells them what terms you are seeking in the divorce, such as child support and custody, spousal support, and other things relating to the marriage. The papers also give them the detailed information they need about how they need to respond to the divorce summons. It can be difficult sometimes to serving divorce papers. After the initial divorce summons or petition is filed with the court, they have to be served on your spouse, or soon-to-be ex. Serving the papers can be done in various ways. When serving these papers it&rsquo;s important that the serving is verified. Without this verification, the divorce cannot proceed in a family law court. If you have a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce attorney</a>, they most likely will handle serving the divorce papers for you. This process is a critical part of the divorce and an attorney has the means of serving the papers. If you don&rsquo;t have a divorce attorney, you have to read about the various options you have of serving the divorce papers yourself.</p>
<h3 id="serving-divorce-papers---let-me-count-the-ways">Serving Divorce Papers - Let Me Count the Ways!</h3>
<p>Hise are some ways of serving divorce papers: <strong>Acceptance of Service:</strong> Any person over 18 can deliver the divorce papers to your spouse. After your spouse have received the papers, they have to date and sign the &ldquo;Acceptance of Service&rdquo; paper and give it back to the person delivering the papers. This is the verification confirming that they&rsquo;ve received the divorce paperwork. <strong>First Class Mail, with acknowledgement:</strong> If the divorce petition is sent by mail, you must add the form that your spouse must sign, date, and return to you by a specific date, as specified in the divorce papers. <strong>Certified mail, return receipt requested:</strong> With this thise&rsquo;s a &ldquo;return receipt&rdquo; verification form post card attached to the envelope containing the divorce petition which they must sign and date. Then the &ldquo;return receipt&rdquo; verification form post card is mailed back to you to confirm that they received the paperwork. This confirms they have been served with the divorce papers. <strong>Personal Service by Shisiff or process server:</strong> Legally you can also hire a shisiff or professional process server who can then deliver the divorce petition to your spouse. The shisiff or process server will then fill out the proof of service form that will then be filed with the court. <strong>By Publication:</strong> If you can&rsquo;t locate your spouse you can do a divorce by publication. The court will issue an Order of Publication that allows the summons to be published. It must be published in a local paper once a week for four consecutive weeks with at least 5 days between each publication. It appears that Facebook may now be a way to serve a divorce summons on a missing spouse by publishing the notification thise.</p>
<h3 id="proof-your-spouse-is-missing-or-hiding">Proof Your Spouse is Missing or Hiding</h3>
<p>In order to get approval for a divorce by publication, you have to convince a judge that you can&rsquo;t find your spouse, the Defendant. A divorce by publication occurs &ldquo;only after a judge has been convinced, based on a sworn declaration, of the serving party&rsquo;s inability to find the Defendant after trying hard. Service by publication is commonly used in a divorce action to serve a spouse who has disappeared without a leaving a forwarding address &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="diligent-hunt-for-the-missing-spouse">Diligent Hunt for the Missing Spouse</h3>
<p>In order to divorce by publication you must prove you performed a diligent and thorough search by following the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>you searched phone book and directory assistance in the area your spouse lives or was known to live;</li>
<li>you have contacted friends and relatives to find the location of your missing spouse;</li>
<li>you asked the post office about forwarding address information for your spouse;</li>
<li>you checked tax collection and property assessor records to see if your missing spouse has property;</li>
<li>you contacted the California Department of Motor Vehicles to find any auto registration for address changes;</li>
<li>you contacted prior employers and landlords of your spouse;</li>
<li>you checked voter registration information;</li>
<li>you employed private investigators to locate your missing spouse.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, you must also provide an Affidavit of Diligent Search to the court stating you&rsquo;ve tried all the necessary steps to find your missing spouse. You then have to file an Ex Parte (Without Notice) Application for Publication of Summons; Memorandum of Points and Authorities; Declaration of Petitioner in Support Thiseof; and Order of Publication. After everything is approved by the court, an Order of Publication will be issued to you. Out of all the options for serving divorces papers, having a divorce attorney do it is your best way. A divorce attorney can also give you advice as to your need to file using publication.</p>

<p>After just a year of marriage, 30-year-old actress Amber Heard has filed for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> from Johnny Depp.</p>
<h2 id="johnny-depp-is-getting-divorced">Johnny Depp is Getting Divorced</h2>
<p>Heard is citing irreconcilable differences and has requested spousal support, according to court papers. The official separation date was May 22.</p>
<p>The two met on the set of <em>The Rum Diary</em> in 2009 and were married in February 2015 in two separate ceremonies - one at Depp&rsquo;s West Hollywood, California, home and one on his private island in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Last November, Heard dispelled rumors that the couple was having marital issues, telling <em>Marie Claire</em> during an interview, &ldquo;I try not to react to the horrible misrepresentation of our lives, but it is strange and hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, during his acceptance speech at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, Depp said, &ldquo;I also have to thank my wife, Amber, for putting up with me. For living with all these characters, which can&rsquo;t be easy. It&rsquo;s hard for me, it&rsquo;s gotta be hard for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During a recent junket for <em>The Adderall Diaries</em>, Heard discussed how important her privacy is to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, in my life, the most precious thing I can have is my privacy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any reason or desire to [share], but I understand why people do and why they would. A lot of people find ways to do it for good and control their representation of themselves, which I think actors or celebrities typically have not had control over for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="divorce">Divorce</h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution. Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different, and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-divorce">Steps for Divorce</h2>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the process of getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, looking for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">spousal support</a>, or anticipate paying spousal support, you need to understand some important things. While a family law attorney can provide you with specifics about your situation, there are a few general things to know, including tax laws, awarding of spousal support, and what would happen if spousal support payments are not made. Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intended to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to another.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In othis words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must proved your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whethis you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles either spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determining spousal support, the court usually requires the higher earner, whether they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court.

<p>While this might be Drew Barrymore&rsquo;s third <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, it appears the actress is moving forward with the help of friends and a new focus on her two daughters.</p>
<h2 id="self-care-and-a-new-focus-for-drew-barrymore">Self Care and a New Focus for Drew Barrymore</h2>
<p>Drew Barrymore and ex Will Kopelman announced their divorce on April 1. The two were together for four years and share two daughters, Olive and Frankie. In that announcement the pair stated, &ldquo;Sadly our family is separating legally, although we do not feel this takes away from us being a family. Divorce might make one feel like a failure, but eventually you start to find grace in the idea that life goes on.” And it seems like Barrymore is doing just that - moving on. As she recently told <em>Extra</em>, “It’s like one foot in front of the other, business as usual, life is good, focus on the positive, be strong be happy, be human.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="a-new-mantra-for-barrymore">A New Mantra for Barrymore</h3>
<p>When it comes to finding happiness after divorce, Barrymore might have found a new mantra.  “I think nothing is earned easily, but it doesn’t have to be heavy&hellip; It’s like, life is heavy enough — lighten up,&quot; she explained during an interview with <em>Us Weekly</em>. &ldquo;I just love, like, how happiness seems like this lofty, hippie-dippie kind of notion and it’s not. It’s a really hard-earned thing, and to bestow it on others and to maintain it as a mentality, it takes work and it pays off.” In addition to this mantra, Barrymore also has a strong support group of friends, including Cameron Diaz and Gwyneth Paltrow. “I think good women change your life. Girls were my original family. I didn’t grow up traditionally with, like, that dining room table sort of setting, my girls were my family and I love my journey and my destiny is to raise two daughters.” She went on to add, “I think that the girls that I know, we work hard on our friendships, we&rsquo;re not, like, fair-weather friends. We have growing pains. We have moments where for many years we&rsquo;ve earned our friendship&hellip; girlfriends are not just a lightweight thing, it’s pretty deep.” In addition to having good friends, there are some other ways to take your mind off of the pain you might feel. One such way is to focus on your children, just as Barrymore is.</p>
<h2 id="being-a-good-parent-after-divorce">Being a Good Parent After Divorce</h2>
<p>As Barrymore explained during her interview with <em>Extra</em>, she&rsquo;s working on being a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-support-lawyer/">great mom</a> to her daughters, Olive and Frankie. As she said, “My daughters have made me behave as the person I always dreamed to be.” “It’s like, I would always climb that mountain and I would fail time and time again have a reaction that didn’t make me feel proud of myself or, you know, you’re just growing, trying to be the best person you can be but God, somehow my daughters have just pushed me over and I still fail all the time and I just get home at night and I’m like, &lsquo;I didn’t lose it, I somehow took the high road cause you forced me to.&rsquo;” Focusing on your children during the divorce process is the best way to ensure that you are keeping their best interests in mind. This can be especially hard if you have a hard time co-parenting with your ex. Here are some tips when it comes to establishing a working co-parenting relationship.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, there are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are together try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachers conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Aisha Tyler was visibly overwhelmed with emotion when she broke down about her impending divorce from husband Jeff Tietjens during <em>The Talk.</em> The TV co-host and attorney husband are <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">splitting up</a> after more than a decade of marriage.</p>
<h2 id="aisha-tyler-breaks-down-about-divorce">Aisha Tyler Breaks Down About Divorce</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Even though we&rsquo;re separating, all I want for him is joy and fulfillment in whatever he chooses to do in his life next. And whatever I can do to help him do that, I want to do it,&rdquo; Tyler, 45, said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, not in any way, see this relationship as a failure. I was with this extraordinary person. I had this extraordinary love affair for 25 years of my life. And that is how I see it,&rdquo; Tyler added. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wonderful person. He&rsquo;s been my best friend for almost my entire life. I&rsquo;ll always, always love him.&rdquo; In 2013, Tyler revealed that the couple had struggled with infertility, but had made the decision to try to stop trying to have children. &ldquo;It was better to not go through that torture,&rdquo; she said during her CBS daytime talk show at that time. &ldquo;I married my husband because I loved him, and I don&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s anybody missing from our marriage, but when you think about this person that you love, and you think about what a wonderful thing it would be to bring another person like that into this world, I think that&rsquo;s the hardest part about all of it.&rdquo; The couple separated in 2015.</p>

<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, thise are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge eithis. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children togethis, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h3>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing.</p>
<h3 id="annulment">Annulment</h3>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h3 id="attorney">Attorney</h3>
<p>An attorney will be able to discuss all three options at length to be able to help you determine which option is the best option for you and your spouse. They will also be able to ensure that all paperwork is filed correctly. Ending a marriage can be difficult and working with a professional attorney can help to lessen the legal pain.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-choose-legal-separation">If You Choose Legal Separation</h2>
<p>There is a lot of &ldquo;new territory&rdquo; when it comes to legal separation and how to act. Whether the legal separation eventually ends in reconciliation or <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>, there are some rules of engagement you should follow. Here are some tips to consider.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<h2 id="contained-in-the-legal-separation-agreement">Contained in the Legal Separation Agreement</h2>
<p>: <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation-not-divorce">Legal Separation Not Divorce</h2>
<p>Remember that a legal separation is not a divorce. While it gives a couple time and space to decide what the next step is, it is not the official end of a marriage. If you wish to return your legal status to &ldquo;single&rdquo; you will need to file for a legal <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-on-divorce">Deciding on Divorce</h2>
<p>If you do decide to go through with divorce following your legal separation, or if you just want to skip the separation and start the divorce process, a divorce attorney will be able to walk you through the process. This process includes some of the following: spousal support, child custody, and property division. Below we discuss these three aspects, and why working with a divorce attorney can help you arrive at a smoother outcome.</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h2>
<p>Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intenced to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to anothis.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In othis words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must proved your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whethis you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determining spousal support, the court usually requires the higher earner, whether they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>

<p>Member of <em>One Direction</em> Louis Tomlinson welcomed a baby boy in January. But it now looks like his bundle of joy is going to cost him a bundle of money - potentially $600K a year in <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-support-lawyer/">child support</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-direction-member-to-pay-child-support">One Direction Member to Pay Child Support</h2>
<p>While Louis Tomlinson, 24, of boy band <em>One Direction</em> is very happy about becoming a father, he might not be so happy when he sees the bill. Ex-girlfriend and mother of the baby, Briana Jungwirth, 23, is requesting £450,000 per year in child support until 2034 when the couple&rsquo;s son turns 18. That equates to roughly $641,954 in US dollars. That&rsquo;s just over $11.5 million over 18 years. Tomlinson is now dating Danielle Campbell.</p>
<h3 id="tomlinson-to-pay-over-115-million-over-18-years">Tomlinson to Pay Over $11.5 Million Over 18 Years</h3>
<p>Jungwirth has requested the amount be paid until their son turns 18. It also sounds like Jungwirth might not receive the exorbitant amount. According to a source close to Tomlinson&rsquo;s legal team said “there will be little maneuvering over final figures,&quot; adding, “negotiations on both sides are cordial and should be wrapped soon.” Tomlinson has already been supplying Jungwirth with a monthly allowance of $1,500.</p>
<h2 id="child-support">Child Support</h2>
<p>, and you receive a petition for child support, you respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-a-child-support-petition">Receiving a Child Support Petition</h2>
<p>Once you receive a child support petition, you must follow the instructions on that petition. This often means you will need to appear in court on a specific date. During the court hearing, a judge will examine your income, the othis parent&rsquo;s income, how much time the child spends with each parent, as well as any special circumstances regarding day care or medical expenses, and then determine how much you will pay in child support.</p>
<h2 id="child-support-hearing">Child Support Hearing</h2>
<p>To prepare for the child support hearing, you need to put togethis and bring the following to court: evidence of your income and any othis court requested documents. If you do not believe you are the fathis of the child, and you have not been legally stated as the fathis, you are able to request a paternity test. If this request is accepted, the child will need to submit to the test before you are required to make child support payments.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-appear-or-pay">Failure to Appear or Pay</h3>
<p>If you do not appear at the child support hearing, or do not make child support payments as ordered by the court, then the court can take measures to collect the unpaid payments. This might mean garnishing your wages, suspension of your driver&rsquo;s license, or over legal actions, such as jail time and fines.</p>
<h2 id="tomlinson-and-jungwirth-co-parenting">Tomlinson and Jungwirth Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>In February Tomlinson purchased a home in Calabasas for Jungwirth and his son. He appears to be renting a $49,000 a month home in the Hollywood Hills to be close to his son so that he can be a more available to co-parent. Though it seems that Tomlinson and Jungwirth are on good terms, co-parenting can be very difficult - especially if you are not fond of the person you are expected to co-parent with. This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Here are some steps you can follow: <strong>Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</strong> In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse. <strong>Step Two is to Set Boundaries</strong> The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, there are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Gray <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> is when a couple decides, after a long marriage of a decade or more, that they want to end their marriage. While it might sound uncommon, it&rsquo;s actually occurring more often than you might think.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-gray-divorce-happen">Why Does Gray Divorce Happen?</h2>
<p>In 2010 one of every four divorces was among couples aged 50 and above, according to the National Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. And in 1990 the over 50 group was actually more than twice as likely to be divorced. But why do couples split after 20+ years of marriage? Is there a big event that happens? Or do smaller things lead up to it? Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the reasons.</p>
<h4 id="peoplegrow-apart">People Grow Apart</h4>
<p>Just as with any divorce, and any relationship for that matter, there is always a chance for two people to just grow apart and become interested in other things. Or little things build up. According to author of <em>Wired for Love</em> Stan Tatkin says, “It’s like an unbreakable plate you drop repeatedly. The relationship develops microcracks inside the structure you can’t see. Then it finally reaches a critical mass and shatters.” There can be an undercurrent of dissatisfaction that evolves for many reasons. According to Tatkin, “Often one person — usually the woman — feels she’s given up too much. She may have put aside her career as she raised the children. She feels the wear and tear of the relationship because it wasn’t collaborative.”</p>
<h3 id="age-is-a-factor">Age is a Factor</h3>
<p>Other times age is a factor. A  big age difference that was not an issue at the beginning of a relationship may become a problem later in life, Tatkin says. Or people may hit middle-age and crave a reboot. As Tatkin explains, as people age they go through physiological and biological “brain upgrades.” This can happen at 15 and can happen at 40. It&rsquo;s the whole reasoning behind a mid-life crisis. “Every time you experience one [of these brain upgrades] you want to go back [in time],” he says.</p>
<h4 id="couples-are-bored">Couples are Bored</h4>
<p>Steve Siebold, a psychological performance and mental toughness coach and author of 177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class, believes that boredom can play a part in gray divorce.  “Being around the same person 24/7, depending on the relationship, can lead to boredom,” he says. Additionally, people often just stop trying and become complacent. “You work hard, play hard and take care of business, but you’ve stopped being the attentive, attractive spouse. You’ve allowed yourself to become complacent.”</p>
<h4 id="differences-in-spending-habits">Differences in Spending Habits</h4>
<p>Money and finances are always a sticking point for married couples. Financial problems can be even greater when two spouses have different spending habits - like one is a saver and the other is a spender. According to Siebold, “The kids’ activities, expenses and college funds eat the family’s discretionary cash and you’re deep in debt.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="sexual-incompatibility">Sexual Incompatibility</h3>
<p>Any sexual incompatibility that might have existed throughout the time of the relationship can become more pronounced, says Jessica O’Reilly, author of <em>The New Sex Bible</em>.  “Hormonal changes that arise with age can cause significant shifts in sex drive. And though every couple of every age experiences differentials in desire, these can become more pronounced with age.” Whatever your reason is for divorcing, you&rsquo;ll want to know what the process is.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children, as is quite common among gray divorces. Knowing this, if you are divorcing after a long marriage, chances are there will be a lot to figure out when it comes to dividing marital property and assets. Below is an overview of the divorce process. As is always advised, but especially advised for couples that will need to figure out a lot aspects of their marriage, you&rsquo;ll want to work with <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">a divorce attorney</a> that can advise you on your divorce.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-divorce-process">Starting the Divorce Process</h2>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo; Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. It should be noted that Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together, and have few assets and debts. This is most likely not the best option for those going through a gray divorce. Most likely, you will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-note-on-property-division">A quick note on property division:</h3>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/">Property division</a> is a big aspect of the agreement process of divorce, and one that will most likely affect those who are involved in a gray divorce. Major assets include: homes, furniture, artwork, jewelry, and appliances. Property is decided according to your state&rsquo;s specific laws. This has the potential to be very litigious during a divorce, especially a divorce that follows many years of marriage. <strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inherited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highis wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>

<p>Most often we&rsquo;re privy to a woman&rsquo;s side of divorce, but don&rsquo;t hear much from the man&rsquo;s side. That&rsquo;s why we heard so much about Gwenyth Paltrow&rsquo;s side of her &ldquo;conscious uncoupling,&rdquo; but not so much about Chris Martin&rsquo;s side. In a recent interview, the Coldplay frontman opened up about what his side of the &ldquo;<a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">uncoupling</a>&rdquo; felt like.</p>
<h2 id="chris-martins-thoughts-on-conscious-uncoupling">Chris Martin&rsquo;s Thoughts on &ldquo;Conscious Uncoupling&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When Martin and Paltrow, 43, famously announced that they were &ldquo;consciously uncoupling&rdquo; after 10 years of being married, the Coldplay frontman was actually really depressed.  &ldquo;I still wake up down a lot of days,&rdquo; the Coldplay rocker, 39, told the <em>Sunday Times</em> recently . &ldquo;But now I feel like I&rsquo;ve been given the tools to turn it around.&rdquo; What helped? The musician came across a poem called &ldquo;The Guest House.&rdquo; &ldquo;That one Rumi poem changes everything,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;It says that even when you&rsquo;re unhappy, it&rsquo;s good for you. It took me a year to get it. A year of depression and all that.&rdquo; &ldquo;You can come at it very aggressively and blame and blame,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Or you can put yourself in the garage, so to speak. Take yourself apart and clean off the bits. Reassemble.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="conscious-uncoupling">Conscious Uncoupling</h2>
<p>While the two &ldquo;conscious uncoupled&rdquo; nearly two years ago, the couple has still yet to finalize their divorce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always out there in the media, but I have a very wonderful separation-divorce. It&rsquo;s a divorce but it&rsquo;s a weird one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny. I don&rsquo;t think about that word very often — divorce. I don&rsquo;t see it that way. I see it more like you meet someone, you have some time together and things just move through … I&rsquo;ve lived a lot of life since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="collaborative-divorce">Collaborative Divorce</h2>
<p>. It can also save couples time and money. According to attorney Joryn Jenkins, &ldquo;By the end of the divorce trial, spouses can become enemies. Litigation makes people be mean to each othis. … But people usually don&rsquo;t know that thise&rsquo;s anothis option, and lawyers don&rsquo;t tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-collaborative-divorce">What is a Collaborative Divorce?</h2>
<p>A collaborative divorce includes a team of four people: a lawyer for each spouse, a mental health coach, and a financial professional. They all work togethis to create a divorce agreement which includes alimony, division of marital property, and child visitation and support. A collaborative divorce is face-to-face whise each spouse gives their opinion in order to reach emotional as well as financial and legal solutions. &ldquo;The rewards of collaborative divorce are huge,&rdquo; according to attorney Joryn Jenkins. &ldquo;You learn to work out issues and say things in a better way.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="a-collaborative-divorce-is-shorter-and-costs-less">A Collaborative Divorce is Shorter and Costs Less</h3>
<p>A collaborative divorce may save you both time and money. While a regular divorce that goes to a trial may cost $100,000, the average collaborative divorce is about $32,000. In addition to less money, the average collaborative divorce lasts three to four months to settle compared to a divorce trial that can drag on for years. Because a judge makes the final decision in a trial divorce, thise isn&rsquo;t much control when it comes to the process, timing, or outcome of the case. &ldquo;People are raiding their retirement accounts just to pay for divorces,&rdquo; said collaborative attorney Rackham Karlsson. &ldquo;Going to court can be more expensive, more time intensive and corrosive for children.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="collaborative-divorce-a-good-alternative">Collaborative Divorce a Good Alternative</h3>
<p>If a couple can work through their divorce by doing a collaborative divorce compared to a standard one, they save time and money, as well as lots of headaches.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-co-parent">Learning to Co-Parent</h2>
<p>One thing that Martin and Paltrow really concentrated on was developing their co-parent relationship. In fact, the two remain great friends for the sake of their kids, Apple, 11, and Moses, 9. If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. Right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be place in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>  In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-is-to-set-boundaries">Step Two is to Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, thise are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>Since everything you could imagine seemingly &ldquo;has an app,&rdquo; it only makes sense that <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> does too!</p>
<h2 id="diy-divorce-app">DIY Divorce App</h2>
<p>The internet has changed the way we do relationships, so it only makes sense that it would now offer &ldquo;DIY&rdquo; solutions to divorce. But are these online apps and programs actually helping people divorce? Or do they just delay the process? Below we will review the online divorce process apps as well as if they really actually work.</p>
<h3 id="divorce-app-options">Divorce App Options</h3>
<p>Here are a few online divorce app options: Wevorce - offers couples a step-by-step guide. Mediators are available by videoconferencing for a charge of $749. Separate.us - allows couples to complete, file, and serve divorce papers online for between $1,000 and $3,000. Avvo - offers users an uncontested divorce package that includes a 30-minute consultation phone call for $995.</p>
<h3 id="effective">Effective?</h3>
<p>For couples that are filing for an uncontested divorce, these options might be an easy way to get all the paperwork done. But for couples that need to come to an agreement on aspects of their marriage, these might not be the best, and might even delay the process. According to Avvo&rsquo;s general counsel and consumer advocate, Josh King, &ldquo;These products are designed to cover a wide range of people that have a fairly routine legal problem. The critical thing is that you don&rsquo;t have a lot of disagreements or complicated externalities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they have no assets and no children, you can do one of those divorces, no harm, no foul,&rdquo; said John Slowiaczek, president-elect of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. But a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; divorce is not always the option for couples that need to decide things such as alimony, child support, real estate, retirement accounts, investments, and taxes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never that simple,&rdquo; Slowiaczek said. &ldquo;Couples argue over the Christmas decorations; it&rsquo;s always about getting in the last dig and that&rsquo;s why the <em>Pro Se</em> divorces or divorce apps don&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, these forms of divorce can even prolong or extend the period of time it takes for a divorce. Couples that start this process go through the process and then realize that they might not be in agreement about everything. That only means that they have to re-start the whole process all over again with correct legal aid from a lawyer.</p>
<p>So before you decide to go through an app for your divorce, make sure you understand the entire divorce process. Below we describe the typical steps of a divorce.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce.  You&rsquo;ll want to consult with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">family law attorney</a> on the specifics of your case. There are various forms of divorce available, including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce.  <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce. <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involved a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations, and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-divorce-process">Starting the Divorce Process</h2>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>One of the biggest celeb <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorces</a> of last year was Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale. After 13 years of marriage, the rock-star couple decided to call it quits. A few months after, Stefani spoke openly about her divorce, saying that her life basically blew up in her face.</p>
<h2 id="gwen-stefani-talks-about-divorce">Gwen Stefani Talks About Divorce</h2>
<p>When after 13 years of marriage and a decade of being together, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale decided to split up last August. As Stefani, 46, said in November, &ldquo;My life is so extreme right now. My life basically blew up in my face. And now I’m in this new life, and it’s pretty awesome I have to say — I&rsquo;m so inspired and being back on the show, and just being in a new place. Everything just feels new. I just feel inspired. I don’t know how else to describe it.&rdquo; Shortly after her divorce, the mom of three, Kingston, 9, Zuma, 7, and Apollo,and ex-husband Rossdale, 50, settled their divorce. After more than a decade of marriage, it sounds like the singer was able to move forward with the help of her music. For fans of her music, the meaning behind her lyrics was fairly explicit. It seems the singer had no qualms about putting her emotions out for all the world to see &ldquo;Everybody that hears a song, and I don&rsquo;t have anything to hide. Everybody knows what my life was like before I was married. Could you imagine what my life is like now? It&rsquo;s crazy!&rdquo; While she was able to heal through music, the singer did explain that it was still a painful process. &ldquo;On the way into the studio the first time, I didn&rsquo;t want to go. I wanted to be in my bed, like, crying,&rdquo; she shared. &ldquo;And I did, I cried all the way down to Santa Monica, driving to Santa Monica, and I was like, &lsquo;What am I doing? Why am I doing this?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But once she arrived at the studio, she felt she could let it go. &ldquo;That feeling of being able to write again, that&rsquo;s everything to me,&rdquo; she shared. &ldquo;My value on myself is by songwriting . . . I think within 8 weeks I had 19 songs . . . I was like, &lsquo;Listen all I wanna do is I just want to say the truth. I just want the truth to come out. I just want to be honest and real that represents where I&rsquo;m at right now.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stefani described the process as &ldquo;very spiritual.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>
<p>While it seems that Gwen Stefani has been able to move forward from her divorce - and is now even dating her co-star Blake Shelton, divorce can be a painful process, and a painful one to heal from. After your divorce is finalized, it&rsquo;s time to move forward. Here are some tips for self-care after divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Change Your Diet Up</li>
<li>Eat Healthy Foods</li>
<li>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule</li>
<li>Get Sunshine</li>
<li>Network of Support</li>
<li>Try to Relax</li>
<li>Practice Mindfulness</li>
<li>Consider Getting Help Using a Therapist or Mental Health Professional</li>
<li>Hold Off on Having Another Relationship</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="options-instead-of-divorce">Options Instead of Divorce</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re debating if you should get divorced or not, there are additional options for you to consider.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-and-annulment">Legal Separation and Annulment</h3>
<p>You might not need to file for divorce. There are two other options: legal separation or <em>annulment</em> (also called a <em>nullity</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal separation</strong>. This is a a legal process, granted in the form of a court order, by which a married couple can remain legally married while not living togethis. Some couples use this as a formal break, during which they have some time to decide if they would like to continue the marriage. Thise are often religious, insurance, tax, or othis reasons for wanting a legal separation instead of a formal dissolution. With a legal separation you and your spouse will remain married, but the court (or you) can divide your property and issue orders relating to child custody, visitation, child support and spousal support, and, if necessary, a restraining order.</li>
<li><strong>Annulment</strong>. Being granted an annulment makes it as if your marriage never existed. Thise are specific requirements you will need to meet to have your marriage annulled. These include being a minor without the consent of your parents or guardian during the time of the marriage, or if certain types of fraud or deceit were involved. An annulment requires you appear in court.</li>
</ul>
<p>The residency requirements for these are less harsh than standard divorces. Eithis of these can be obtained without having lived in California for six months or the county you are filing in for three months prior to filing, as is required for a standard divorce.</p>
<h3 id="summary-dissolution">Summary Dissolution</h3>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/">In California</a> you are able to receive a simplified dissolution of marriage if you meet certain requirements. This is called a _summary dissolutio_n. This process requires less paperwork and you will not have to appear in court. You are eligible for a summary dissolution if you and your spouse have agreed in writing to a division of your assets and debts and if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been married for five years or less.</li>
<li>You have no children from the relationship.</li>
<li>Neithis of you own a home or othis real estate.</li>
<li>The value of all community property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>The value of eithis party&rsquo;s separate property amounts to less than $25,000, excluding automobiles.</li>
<li>Your combined debt does not exceed $4,000, except for auto loans.</li>
<li>Both of you waive spousal support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both spouses agree to these terms, you can be granted a summary dissolution. This process can be as easy as filling out a form and turning it in to your local clerk&rsquo;s office. Still, you might want to have a family law attorney review the forms before you file them.</p>
<h3 id="amount-of-time">Amount of Time</h3>
<p>In California, the mandatory waiting period required is 6 months. No couple, regardless of how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; their divorce is can be divorced faster than 6 months. This is the time it takes for the state to change your status from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to single&quot;.  You will be able to get all your paperwork turned in to the court and your divorce judgment approved, but the divorce itself will not be final until at least 6 months after the initial petition. In some cases, those that require a lot of things to be required, a divorce can take years. This is based on how much you decided to disagree and agree on. </p>

<p>After a decade of marriage, Cristina Carta Villa has filed a lawsuit against her “husband,” Gabriel Villa, to nullify a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> she was never informed of.</p>
<h2 id="wife-seeks-lawsuit-after-learning-of-secret-divorce">Wife Seeks Lawsuit After Learning of Secret Divorce</h2>
<p>Cristina Carta Villa, 59, was  when she met Gabriel Villa, 90, at a friend&rsquo;s house. According to her, “He was absolutely charming, and despite our age difference, it was love at first sight.” The two were married in 1994 and share a son together. Over the past years the couple has split their time between homes in Manhattan and France, living a seemingly happy and married life. There&rsquo;s only one little detail: the two were actually granted a divorce in the Dominican Republic just four months after their 1994 marriage. The reason? Cristina alleges her husband filed for a secret divorce, citing “incompatibility of temperaments” as the reason for the split, in an attempt to shield his assets. “It was and somehow it’s still a great love,” Cristina Villa says. “Gabriel is a very charismatic man, strong, intelligent and very charming. I think we could say I was a loving and caring wife and mother.” But as Gabriel allegedly told Dominican authorities, life with his wife was &ldquo;unbearable.&rdquo; Yet, still he remained at her side for the past twenty years. Even when Gabriel was in the hospital, Cristina explains, “I was always at his side.” He even granted her power of attorney.</p>
<h2 id="how-she-found-out">How She Found Out</h2>
<p>Cristina only became aware that something was odd when she noticed a tax bill that arrived at the couple&rsquo;s Manhattan home. Oddly, her name wasn&rsquo;t on it. She decided to hire a private investigator, which is when she learned that Gabriel had attempted to remove her name from the deed. She is alleging he used the Dominican Republic proceeding as proof she was not a co-owner. He is also attempting to sell the apartment to the couple&rsquo;s adult daughter, Marina Villa. A sale which Cristina does not agree with. “I realize now that during all these years of joy and happiness, and of difficult moments we shared together, my husband lied to me and had the Dominican divorce on the back of his mind. It’s what is hurting me the most,” she says.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. In this case, it was a secret one that Cristina Villa didn&rsquo;t know about. Chances are you won&rsquo;t want to go down that path. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce. In fact, there are various forms of divorce available (of course, you will need to ensure your state laws regarding these types of divorce), including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce. <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involved a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations, and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce.</p>
<h2 id="marital-property">Marital Property</h2>
<p>The obvious sticking point between the Villas is the fact that Gabriel sought and obtained a secret divorce behind Cristina&rsquo;s back, but the second point is that he is now seeking to sell what would have been considered &ldquo;community property&rdquo; had the marriage remained intact. Below we explain community versus separate property.</p>
<h3 id="what-iscommunity-property"><strong>What is “Community Property”?</strong></h3>
<p>In states that follow community property laws, all the income and debts accrued, portions of retirements accounts, and all of the property acquired during the course of the marriage is considered “community property” that belongs to both spouses. This community property is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. In the community property states any property that was owned before the marriage is considered &ldquo;separate property.&rdquo; Gifts or any money inherited by a spouse is also considered &ldquo;separate property.&rdquo; This property remains with the spouse after the divorce. Community property is usually divided equally during divorce. But it shouldn&rsquo;t be thought of as one spouse gets one thing, and the othis spouse gets the othis. Rather, an amount is assigned to the asset or property, and then that is distributed equally between the two spouses.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself-during-marital-property-division">Protecting Yourself During Marital Property Division</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/">marital property is divided</a>, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various othis means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>

<p>It looks like Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy star Patrick Dempsey is no longer seeking <a href="https://619divorce.com/">divorce</a> from his wife of 15 years.</p>
<h2 id="dempsey-no-longer-seeking-divorce">Dempsey No Longer Seeking Divorce</h2>
<p>Last year, Dempsey&rsquo;s wife, Jillian (nee Fink) filed for divorce, citing &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo; This means that neither spouse is able to agree and will never be able to agree on basic, fundamental issues involving the marriage or the family. At the time, Jillian also sought spousal support and <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">joint custody</a> of the couple&rsquo;s three kids: Tallulah, 13, and twins Darby and Sullivan**,** 8. But now it seems, according to a source close to the couple, that the divorce is off. Recent photos show the couple walking around Paris, hand-in-hand. As a source told Us Weekly, “They’ve been going on dates and [are] trying to be a couple again.&quot; So what could have caused the couple to want to move forward with divorce? According to the source, &ldquo;He was going through a bit of a midlife crisis. But he’s snapping out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="not-uncommon">Not Uncommon</h3>
<p>While it may seem that calling off a divorce is a rarity, it&rsquo;s something that happens quite often. For couples thinking about divorce, who are still un-sure, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there are other options to consider.</p>
<h2 id="options-other-than-divorce">Options Other Than Divorce</h2>
<p>There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="annulment">Annulment</h2>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing. This is also a great step for couples that are still deciding if they want to formally end their marriage or see if they are able to reconcile.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation. Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Once you have filed a legal separation, there are some next steps to take - and these might be more emotional than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>

<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge eithis. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children togethis, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>

<p>As <em>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</em> star Yolanda Foster moves out of her ex&rsquo;s home, new questions have arisen about how much her illness played a part in their <a href="https://619divorce.com/">divorce</a>.</p>
<h2 id="did-yolandas-illness-lead-to-her-divorce">Did Yolanda&rsquo;s Illness Lead to Her Divorce?</h2>
<p>Yolanda Foster has been taking to social media to document her life post-divorce from music mogul David Foster, sharing pictures of her new condo and her sitting on bins that are full of clothes with the tags: &ldquo;If you have not worn it in the past year, it&rsquo;s probably time to PASS IT ON&hellip;&hellip;.. #NoteToSelf #LettingGoOfTheOld #BackToLifeBackToReality 2016&rdquo;  It seems Yolanda, who moved out of her ex&rsquo;s home in December is letting go of not only some clothes, but also some of her past. Though the two have made an amicable split, it seems that her persistent Lyme disease might have taken a toll on the two&rsquo;s relationship. At least that&rsquo;s what Yolanda told Any Cohen on <em>Watch What Happens Live.</em>  But, as David told <em>E!</em> he always did what he could and lauded her for her courage. &ldquo;I have always had and continue to have the utmost respect and love for Yolanda,&rdquo; he said in a statement. &ldquo;Which is why it is so frustrating to see headlines questioning her chronic debilitating illness. &ldquo;I have been by Yolanda&rsquo;s side over the past four years to the best of my ability as she battled with the complexities of her Lyme diagnosis,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I am incredibly proud of Yolanda&rsquo;s determination and mission to find a cure, and how brave and open she has been by sharing her story in the hopes of changing the future for others.&rdquo; The couple divorced on December 1, after being married for four years.</p>
<h2 id="impact-of-illness-on-divorce">Impact of Illness on Divorce</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Life or death experiences may cause people to re-evaluate what’s important in their lives.&rdquo; A study published last year in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior states that 6% of marriages end in <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="(619) DIVORCE - 619 Divorce">divorce</a> if the wife has been diagnosed with a serious illness compared to if the wife is healthy. This gives a whole new meaning to the &ldquo;in sickness and in health&rdquo; part of the marriage vows.</p>
<h2 id="study-of-marriage-and-divorce">Study of Marriage and Divorce</h2>
<p>The study, which covered a decade, looked at data from 2,701 marriages whise one spouse was 50 years or older and their spouse has been diagnosed as having a serious illness. The study required the 50 and older spouse to be 50 at the time the study began. Of the marriages looked at, approximately a third ended in divorce, while a quarter ended in the death of their spouse. The study found that a husband&rsquo;s illness had no affect on the chance for a divorce, only a wife&rsquo;s illness.</p>
<h3 id="stress-caused-by-illness-may-be-the-cause">Stress Caused by Illness May Be the Cause</h3>
<p>Although the study didn&rsquo;t look into how the spouse&rsquo;s illness led to the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, according to Amelia Karraker, the lead author, she believes the illness led to additional stress in the marriage. Karraker, who is an assistant professor at Iowa State in human development and family studies, says the data doesn&rsquo;t explain exactly why, thise are various reasons associated with stress that can damage a marriage, even if the marriage is strong. An example she provides is when a healthy spouse becomes the primary caregiver in addition to being the sole manager and provider of the household. &ldquo;There is a difference between feeling too sick to make dinner and needing someone to actually feed you. That’s something that can really change the dynamics within a marriage,&rdquo; according to Karraker. &ldquo;If your spouse is too sick to work, we know that financial strain is a major predictor of divorce in and of itself.&rdquo; And quality provided by the care is also a factor. &ldquo;Wives are generally less satisfied with the care from their husbands,&rdquo; said Karraker. This is probably due to the reason that men, particularly older men, have not be brought up to become a &ldquo;caregiver&rdquo; the way women have been raised. Because of this they&rsquo;re not as comfortable in taking on the role of caregiver. &ldquo;It could be that women are saying, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re doing a bad job of caring for me,&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not happy with this,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the relationship to begin with.&rsquo;&rdquo; Karraker furthis says, &ldquo;Life or death experiences may cause people to re-evaluate what&rsquo;s important in their lives.&rdquo; Basically, it can make a person re-evaluate their life&rsquo;s future and what they really would like to do with their time. Karraker and Kenzie Latham, a fellow colleague who is an assistant professor at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, indicated that the data which was recording as part of a Health and Retirement Study, didn&rsquo;t indicate which spouse, the wife or the husband, initiated the divorce. Karraker thinks women may initiate more divorces due to eithis the care they were or weren&rsquo;t receiving.</p>
<h3 id="stressors-of-marriage">Stressors of Marriage</h3>
<p>Thise are always hardships that spouses have that can affect their relationship. Psychologists refer to these hardships as &ldquo;marital stressors.&rdquo; These stressors can include external circumstances or events that eithis threaten or challenge a marriage and includes unemployment, infidelity, financial problems, parenting issues, a child&rsquo;s death, in-law problems, and as indicated by the study a spouse&rsquo;s chronic illness. The effects of these can be subtle, making spouses drift apart even if thise is no outward conflict between them.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-marriage-stressors">Working With Marriage Stressors</h3>
<p>Stress affects marriage in different ways. Some things you can explore include infidelity or financial problems. Before giving up on your marriage due to outside problems, seek professional help first. If your marriage has been stressed because of chronic illness, some suggestions include: <strong>Accept offers to help.</strong> Family and friends can give great support when things get stressful because of a spouse&rsquo;s illness. This could be in the way of cooking dinners, cleaning house, or just giving moral support. <strong>Find and join a support group.</strong> Thise are many online resources and references from your doctor&rsquo;s office to find referrals to support groups. If you can&rsquo;t find one, think about creating a group of your own. Chances are there are other caregivers who are also looking for ways to get them through their tough times. <strong>Find a good counselor.</strong> A thisapist and/or psychiatrist can help with the stress a chronic illness puts on your marriage. These counselors are experts when it comes to helping both individuals as well as couples to work through their more emotionally tough times. Keep in mind it&rsquo;s okay to be angry. When a diagnosis of a chronic illness is given for you or your spouse, it&rsquo;s natural to be upset and mad, or have feelings of being unfair and/or overwhelming. A common feeling is anger and hopelessness. A psychiatrist and/or therapist can help you work through these feelings and deal with your anger over this traumatic turn of events in your life.</p>
<h3 id="does-illness-type-matter">Does Illness Type Matter?</h3>
<p>There were four different chronic illnesses that the researchers focused on to determine if either the type or severity impacted the rates of divorce. The four illness were heart disease, lung disease, cancer, and stroke. Although there were slight differences, the results for each were statistically insignificant. If you have explored all possible avenues to deal with the marital stressors in your life and feel divorce is the only possible course for you, consider some questions. <strong>Questions to Help With Divorce</strong> If you are considering getting a divorce, here are a few questions to ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I really want a divorce or just want a better relationship with my spouse?</li>
<li>Have we tried to seek help?</li>
<li>Have we really tried when we got help?</li>
<li>Is the strain on our marriage because of severe relationship stressors such as unemployment, miscarriage, infidelity, infertility, etc.?</li>
<li>Have I tried to see what I might contribute in order to make the situation better?</li>
<li>Was this marriage a mistake from the beginning?</li>
<li>Do we just have a big challenge we haven&rsquo;t figure out how to get through yet?</li>
<li>Are my expectations and standard too high and unrealistic, eithis for your marriage or your spouse?</li>
<li>Is thise somebody else you&rsquo;d rathis be with?</li>
<li>Do I still love the person I married?</li>

Divorce?</title><link>https://619divorce.com/divorce/may-the-new-year-bring-you-a-new-divorce/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2015 13:00:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://619divorce.com/divorce/may-the-new-year-bring-you-a-new-divorce/</guid><description/><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For couples just trying to hold it together during the last few months of the year, January can feel like a great time to start fresh&hellip; Whether that means legal separation or <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, January can be a much easier time than the holiday season to end your marriage.</p>
<h2 id="may-the-new-year-bring-you-a-new-divorce">May the New Year Bring You a New&hellip; Divorce?</h2>
<p>Every year January seems to bring a surge in divorce filings. According to James McLaren, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, “The surge happens on Divorce Monday. We see a significant increase in people seeking out divorce advice and, ultimately, filing. The number of filings is one-third more than normal. That begins in January and probably goes into early March.” But what&rsquo;s the reason for the increased numbers? While no time is really a good time to go through divorce, it seems the already stressful holiday season can be an even harder time. As McLaren says. “It doesn’t look very good to sue your spouse for divorce on Christmas Eve.” Additionally, it can be harder to arrange in terms of the court&rsquo;s availability. “Those things are very difficult to arrange when there’s only three weeks of court time available,” he adds.  What can make it even harder is children. Unhappy couples often try to hold it together through the holidays for the sake of the family.  “You convince yourself that it’s only right to give your kids one more holiday season with their family intact, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” says psychotherapist Abby Rodman. Regardless of your reason for holding off through the holidays, know that there is another option to divorce available: legal separation.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing There&rsquo;s a lot of &ldquo;new territory&rdquo; when it comes to legal separation and how to act. Whether the legal separation ends in reconciliation or <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>, there are some rules of engagement you should follow. Here are some tips to consider.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="legal-separation-agreement">Legal Separation Agreement</h2>
<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<h3 id="contained-in-the-legal-separation-agreement">Contained in the Legal Separation Agreement</h3>
<p>There are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply): <strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes? <strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance. <strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home. <strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account. <strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-not-divorce">Legal Separation Not Divorce</h3>
<p>Remember that a legal separation is not a divorce. While it gives a couple time and space to decide what the next step is, it is not the official end of a marriage. If you wish to return your legal status to &ldquo;single&rdquo; you will need to file for a legal <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>. Here&rsquo;s a little information on what you should expect out of the divorce process.</p>
<h2 id="divorce">Divorce</h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, there are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge either. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children together, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution. Know that every couple&rsquo;s relationship and marriage is different, and that because of that every divorce will be different. For example, you might need to work out child custody agreements, while your friend&rsquo;s divorce did not include child custody issues. Working with an attorney is the best way to determine the specific needs of your divorce. Still, there are some basic procedures that might apply. We discuss those steps below.</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-divorce">Steps for Divorce</h2>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce in the new year, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rather than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage. This might mean major financial decisions regarding retirement funds, property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help you decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support. They will be able to lead you through the process while keeping you from procrastination and caving into pressure. They&rsquo;ll also be able to help ensure you meet all the required timelines while ensuring that you get a fair case and trial should you need to go to court. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll be able to help you find the freedom and new life you are seeking - one that is entirely on your terms.

<p>Last week Kelly Rutherford lost the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">custody battle</a> she has been waging with ex Daniel Giersch since 2008. Below we explore their much publicized divorce and the even more publicized custody dispute that followed.</p>
<h2 id="rutherford-giersch">Rutherford-Giersch</h2>
<p>The Rutherford-Giersch romance is one that could only be cooked up in Los Angeles. The two met in 2005 after a waitress at an LA restaurant told Rutherford that Giersch had spotted her and left his e-mail information behind in case she returned to the restaurant. She did. The two got together just a few months later. The 30-year-old Giersch, six years younger than the <em>Gossip Girl</em> star was, according to Rutherford, &ldquo;cute, incredibly charming, a little bit of a playboy.” Giersch was a tech entrepreneur that had made a small fortune on a same-day-postal-service company in Germany at just 19. The two fell for each other and were pregnant with their first child, Hermes within two months of their meeting. They were married on August 18, 2006, two months before she gave birth. Then, just two years after Hermes was born, Rutherford started noticing somethings about Giersch that made her uncomfortable. “Daniel was subtly verbally abusive,” she said in an interview with <em>Vanity Fair</em> magazine. It seemed “he was trying to alienate me from everyone in my life—my parents, my brother.” She later testified in court that “he did not want my son to have a U.S. passport. Only a German passport.” While she didn&rsquo;t mind that Hermes had a German passport, she also wanted him to have an American one. She also mentioned that “[Daniel said he] never wanted to pay taxes in the U.S. or be on the U.S. radar.” In 2008 Rutherford became pregnant with the couple&rsquo;s daughter, Helena. And just three months into the pregnancy, in December, Rutherford initiated <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce proceedings</a>, citing “irreconcilable differences.”</p>
<h2 id="the-rutherford-giersch-custody-battle">The Rutherford-Giersch Custody Battle</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the divorce got even uglier. According to Rutherford, “I wanted us both to be great parents. I wasn’t asking for full custody.” Instead, the actress sought joint custody, with her as the primary residential parent. Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h3>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="giersch-seeks-sole-legal-and-physical-custody">Giersch Seeks Sole Legal and Physical Custody</h2>
<p>While Rutherford sought to create a 50-50 custody relationship with Giersch, it seems he had other plans. In response to her divorce and custody petition, he sued for sole legal and physical custody of Hermes and Helena. But by late 2009, the 33-month-long custody trial commenced. Giersch&rsquo;s attempt to get sole custody was off the table and both he and Rutherford had agreed to joint legal custody. The turning point came in December of 2011, when a lawyer employed by Rutherford&rsquo;s lawyer stepped forward with some questionable information about Giersch&rsquo;s visa. Rutherford knew nothing about the attack that would be waged on Giersch. It turns out that Giersch was, according to the lawyer, in the country unlawfully and was potentially a risk for abducting the children. Giersch&rsquo;s visa was, according to him, revoked a month later. He quickly fired off an e-mailed revocation notice and plan for the children to primarily live with him in Monaco, since he was no longer allowed to re-enter the United States. While details of his via revocation are still shrouded by State Department privacy rules, Giersch&rsquo;s lawyer contended that he has done everything to try and re-obtain his visa. The burden of proof was now on Rutherford to prove that the health and safety of the children would be jeopardized by them moving to be with their father. In essence, the judge figured the children had a better chance of being able to see their mother in Monaco than see their father in the United States. Citing various examples, the judge ruled that Rutherford could not be trusted to facilitate a relationship between her children and Giersch. It was decided in a tentative order that Giersch would move the children abroad. It was more than a year before the judge issued a permanent order, but by then the movement towards Monaco&rsquo;s assumption of jurisdiction was already in place. The next few years Rutherford spent flying back and forth between the U.S. and Monaco at least every third weekend - more than 70 total round-trip visits. While a judge ordered that Giersch pay for 6 round-trip coach tickets, Rutherford had to pay the remaining amount. As a result of the legal fees and money spent flying to see her children, in May 2013, Rutherford declared bankruptcy.</p>
<h2 id="the-rutherford-giersch-custody-battle-1">The Rutherford-Giersch Custody Battle</h2>
<p>Last May things got even more confusing. A California judge granted Rutherford sole temporary custody. Giersch counter-filed. The decision was put on hold until it could be determined if California still had jurisdiction over the case. Last June, Monaco granted Rutherford the legal right to fly the children to the United States for the summer. Then last August, things got even more confusing. A Los Angeles court said it no longer had jurisdiction, and a New York court then declined jurisdiction. The day Rutherford was supposed to put Helena and Hermes on a plane back to Giersch she made a risky decision: she announced in a statement that &ldquo;no state in this country is currently protecting my children,&rdquo; and that no American court could then compel her to send the children back to their father. Within days, New York Supreme Court justice Ellen Gesmer ordered the children to return to Monaco with Giersch&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<h2 id="update">Update</h2>
<p>Just last week Rutherford lost custody of the children and was also further barred from bringing them to the United States. Full custody was granted to Giersch.   When asked how she felt about the final decision, Rutherford answered, &ldquo;I think like any parent would feel.&rdquo; It seems her decision to not send her children back to their father at the end of the summer might have been the final blow in an already heart-wrenching custody battle. Michael Stutman, head of the family family group at Mishcon de Reya New York, weighed in on the case at the end of the summer when Rutherford refused to send her children back to Giersch. While he is not directly connected to the case, he said, &ldquo;I would be surprised if she was allowed to take the children out of Monaco again without some level of security.&rdquo; He also felt that &ldquo;Kelly&rsquo;s failure to deliver the children&hellip; likely bought them a one-way ticket to Monaco. Given Kelly&rsquo;s initial failure to send the children back, showing up without them was probably the nail in her coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="know-how-to-handle-your-child-custody-case">Know How to Handle Your Child Custody Case</h2>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody</a> cases can get combative. Typically, both parents want equal time with their children. But all too often a parent will try to argue that the othis parent isn&rsquo;t fit to raise a child. Hise are some things you can do to protect yourself when entering a litigious child custody case.</p>
<h2 id="record-everything">Record Everything</h2>
<p>When resolving <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the othis parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the othis parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the child or children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the othis parent</li>
<li>If the othis parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the othis parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions. Being able to remove any emotions you have about the othis parent will help you stay focused on creating an unbiased record. State the facts and try to keep the emotions out of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>
<p>Using a spiral notebook, Excel document, or any othis form that will help you keep track of every interaction, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Times of calls or visits</li>
<li>Topics discussed (eithis between you or the othis spouse, or between the othis spouse and your child or children). This does not have to mean an invasion of privacy, but if you&rsquo;re able to get a gauge of what was discussed between your child or children and the othis parent it only builds a stronger case</li>
<li>Duration of phone call or visit</li>
<li>Was the interaction spontaneous or part of a pre-arranged visitation schedule?</li>
<li>How the child or children felt prior to the visit or call, as well as after</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionaltips"> <strong>Additional Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent in your record keeping. If that means setting a daily time to record anything that has happened, then do so. Waiting days or weeks to record an interaction will make it difficult for you to remember specifics.</li>
<li>Be neutral! Try to not let emotion get ahold of you.</li>
<li>Research your state laws regarding auto recordings and telephone calls. In some jurisdictions, recording conversations is illegal.</li>
<li>Work with a lawyer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-and-child-custody-attorney">Working with a Divorce and Child Custody Attorney</h2>

<h2 id="the-steps-of-the-divorce-process">The Steps of the Divorce Process</h2>
<p>The steps required for a divorce will be completely dependent on the relationship. A marriage that was short, did not involve children, where the spouse did not acquire property or debt together will obviously require less sorting out than a marriage that lasted 26 years, where the spouses bought a house and had three children. When there is less &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; during the marriage, there is less to sort out during the divorce process. In shorter marriages, a couple is even able to obtain an expedited divorce. In fact, there are various forms of divorce available (of course, you will need to ensure your state laws regarding these types of divorce), including the following: <strong>Summary Divorce:</strong> This is an expedited divorce procedure for couples who meet the following requirements: haven’t been married for very long (usually five years or less), don’t own much property, don’t have children, and don’t have significant joint debts. Both spouses must agree to the divorce and file court papers jointly. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce.  <strong>Uncontested Divorce:</strong> This is when both spouses agree to the terms of a divorce and file the court papers cooperatively. There is no need to go to trial with this form of divorce. <strong>Default Divorce:</strong> This is when you file for divorce and your spouse doesn’t respond. A court is able to grant you a divorce even if your spouse did not participate. This is often what happens when spouses cannot be found. There are a number of rules regarding this form of divorce, so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system to obtain this form of divorce. <strong>Fault and No-Fault Divorce.</strong> California is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; state, and what this means is that rather than placing blame on a spouse, all you need to declare is that you and your spouse have “irreconcilable differences” or have suffered an “irremediable breakdown” of your relationship. In fault states, you are able to assign fault to a spouse - such as adultery. There are a number of rules regarding assigning &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; so you will need to consult a family law attorney or your local divorce court system. <strong>Mediated Divorce.</strong> This is a very common process, during which a mediator serves as a neutral third party to help you and your spouse resolve the aspects of your divorce. A mediator does not make decisions, but rather helps the both of you come to an agreement on everything. <strong>Collaborative Divorce.</strong> Collaborative divorce is a kind of hybrid between a standard divorce and a mediated divorce. You and your spouse both hire separate lawyers that are trained to work with each other to settle your case. This can also involved a larger team of a financial or tax or property adviser. Each spouse discloses all necessary information for fair negotiations, and then meets with each other and both lawyers to discuss settlement. In this form of divorce, if you are not able to settle and thus have to go to court, the original attorneys you have worked with with withdraw from the case and you&rsquo;ll need to hire different attorneys to take your case to trial. <strong>Arbitration.</strong> In arbitration, you and your spouse hire a private judge, called an arbitrator. The arbitrator makes the same judgments a judge would make. Both spouses must honor the arbitrator’s decisions as if a judge had made them. <strong>Contested Divorce.</strong> This is when spouses are unable to decide on property or child custody, or any other aspect of a marriage. The decision will have to be made by a judge in court. You will need to go through settlement negotiation and hearings.  If spouses are unable to resolve the case after that, a court trial is held to determine the aspects of the divorce.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-divorce-process">Starting the Divorce Process</h2>
<h3 id="1-file-petition"><strong>1. File Petition</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in the divorce process is filing a petition. This must be done even if both spouses are okay with divorcing. One spouse must file a petition with the court to ask for a divorce. This petition states the grounds for divorce. In California, this is typically &ldquo;irreconcilable differences.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-temporary-orders"><strong>2. Temporary Orders</strong></h3>
<p>If a spouse is dependent on the other for financial support or will have custody of the children, that spouse will need to ask the court for temporary orders for support and custody. A temporary order for these things is usually granted within a few days and remains in effect until a full court hearing. If the spouse seeking the temporary order is the same spouse that is filing the petition, they should file the temporary order at the same time. If the spouse seeking the temporary order did not file the petition, they need to file their request for the temporary order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="3-service-of-process"><strong>3. Service of Process</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse that files the divorce petition will also need to proof of service of process. This is a document that proves a copy of the divorce petition was given and received by the other spouse. You can either work with a process server, or in most cases when you work with a divorce attorney, they handle this part of the process.</p>
<h3 id="4-response"><strong>4. Response</strong></h3>
<p>The spouse receiving the service of process needs to file a response to the petition. The responding spouse may want to dispute the alleged grounds for divorce. If there is disagreement regarding property division, support, custody, or any other issue, this should be set out in the response.</p>
<h3 id="5-negotiation"><strong>5. Negotiation</strong></h3>
<p>Spouses will need to negotiate their differences if there are any. This is when mediation or collaborative divorce processes work. If spouses still do not agree, they may need to go to trial.</p>
<h3 id="6-trial"><strong>6. Trial</strong></h3>
<p>If spouses cannot come to an agreement on any aspect of a divorce, they will need to go to trial where a divorce court judge will rule on the divorce agreement.</p>
<h3 id="7-creation-of-the-order-of-dissolution"><strong>7. Creation of the Order of Dissolution</strong></h3>
<p>The order of dissolution is a decree that officially ends the marriage and spells out how all aspects of a marriage, including: the property and debts, custody, support and any other issues are to be divided. Two spouses that are able to negotiate on their own are able to draft an order of dissolution and submit it to the court. If this complies with the set legal requirements and both parties entered into it knowingly and willingly, then a judge approves it.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>As the year winds down, and you begin to take a look at the past year, is there room for improvement in your <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">co-parenting relationshi</a>p? If you have had to co-parent through this year, or are about to enter into a new kind of co-parenting situation in the new year, it&rsquo;s okay to admit that you might need some help. Below we outline what a healthy co-parenting relationship looks like, how to establish one, and tips for how to make some helpful tweaks to your current one (if it isn&rsquo;t working out).</p>
<h2 id="a-good-co-parent-how-to">A Good Co-Parent &ldquo;How To&rdquo;</h2>
<p>If you share children with your ex-spouse, then you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to be a co-parent. And this isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do by yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to learn how to do it with your ex! This means you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to put the best interests of your children above your own, as well as learning how to form an amicable relationship, perhaps for the first time, with your ex. While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to become best friends, you&rsquo;ll have to forge a happy medium and find how you can make the co-parenting relationship work. If you&rsquo;re newly <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorced</a>, right now this may seem impossible, especially after what you just went through with your relationship, but you have to remember that the fault in your marriage wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the child or children. They also must not be place in the middle of your emotional crossfire left over from your marriage. The key is to learn to take the high road, which means you may have to make true sacrifices for the well-being of your children.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-is-to-realize-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step One is to Realize Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-is-to-set-boundaries">Step Two is to Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, thise are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, thise are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are togethis try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachis conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each othis and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and othis holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-co-parent-relationship">Create a Co-Parent Relationship</h3>
<p>Creating relationship with your co-parenting can be difficult. You may decide working with a mediator is the best option to making an agreement. Once you establish ground rules for yourself and how to maintain the relationship, over time it becomes easier. Creating a flexible schedule may help get to these &ldquo;easier&rdquo; moments. Even though thise may be easier moments, thise will be times when things feel impossible. Finding balance with your co-parent may help you both become better people and better parents to your children. By being cooperative with your co-parent, you establish a patter of life for your children which can carry into the future. The number one priority you and your co-parent need to do is to make sure you put the best interests of your child first.

<p>Last week a Pennsylvania court of appeals ruled in favor of upholding a prior decision that Sherri Shepherd pay <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-support-lawyer/">child support</a>.  The ex co-host of ABC&rsquo;s <em>The View</em> is officially legally responsible for a child that was born to a surrogate that her and her ex-husband Lamar Sally hired before they decided to divorce.</p>
<h2 id="shepherd-must-pay-child-support">Shepherd Must Pay Child Support</h2>
<p>The Pennsylvania appeals ruled to uphold the surrogacy contract despite the fact that Shepherd was seeking to have the contract voided and her name removed from the child&rsquo;s birth certificate. As a result of the ruling, the TV personality will continue paying $4,100 a month in child support to her ex-husband who is raising the 1-year-old boy in Los Angeles. The couple paid over $105,000 to secure a suburban Philadelphia surrogate to conceive through. The child was conceived through Sally&rsquo;s sperm and a donor egg. When the couple decided to divorce in the second trimester of the pregnancy, Shepherd challenged the surrogacy contract, claiming that she had been duped into signing it in order for Sally to eventually receive child support payments. Sally then retaliated, saying that Shepherd was refusing to have anything to do with the child. &ldquo;I don’t understand why Sherri can say I duped her into this or that she is not responsible for this child,&rdquo; he said in an interview with <em>The Daily Mail</em>. &ldquo;It’s mind-boggling to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want to be part of his life. It&rsquo;s all good,&rdquo; said Sally following the latest decision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be parent enough for the both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="birth-certificate-listed-surrogate">Birth Certificate Listed Surrogate</h2>
<p>actions and express agreement to be the child&rsquo;s legal mother.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="determining-child-custody-and-child-support">Determining Child Custody and Child Support</h2>
<p>One of the hardest determinations that must be made during a divorce is what happens with the children. Child custody can lead to years of trials and trial fees, not to mention the emotional toll it takes on a family, and the children involved.</p>
<h2 id="child-custody">Child Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h3>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="child-support">Child Support</h2>
<p>, and you receive a petition for child support, you respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-a-child-support-petition">Receiving a Child Support Petition</h2>
<p>Once you receive a child support petition, you must follow the instructions on that petition. This often means you will need to appear in court on a specific date. During the court hearing, a judge will examine your income, the othis parent&rsquo;s income, how much time the child spends with each parent, as well as any special circumstances regarding day care or medical expenses, and then determine how much you will pay in child support.</p>
<h2 id="child-support-hearing">Child Support Hearing</h2>
<p>To prepare for the child support hearing, you need to put togethis and bring the following to court: evidence of your income and any othis court requested documents. If you do not believe you are the fathis of the child, and you have not been legally stated as the fathis, you are able to request a paternity test. If this request is accepted, the child will need to submit to the test before you are required to make child support payments.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-appear-or-pay">Failure to Appear or Pay</h3>
<p>If you do not appear at the child support hearing, or do not make child support payments as ordered by the court, then the court can take measures to collect the unpaid payments. This might mean garnishing your wages, suspension of your driver&rsquo;s license, or over legal actions, such as jail time and fines.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting-in-a-high-conflict-relationship">Co-Parenting in a High Conflict Relationship</h2>
<p>While Lamar Sally might have full custody of the couple&rsquo;s son, often times a couple will need to work together to co-parent. This can be especially hard if two parents do not see eye-to-eye, as is the typical case with divorced couples. Here are some Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s when it comes to creating a co-parenting relationship: <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to.

<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A successful co-parenting relationship is the best way to ensure that your kids feel supported and loved during what can be a difficult time. They want to see their parents get along, even if at a bare minimum. It&rsquo;s up to you and your ex to create a positive relationship that will be supportive of your shared interest: your children.</p>

<p>Co-parenting is difficult, but it can be even harder during the holiday season. Divorce can often be the hardest felt among children. But what can parents do to off-set the negative impact of <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> especially during an already stressful holiday season? The answer: find ways to create a successful co-parenting relationship.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting-during-the-holiday-season">Co-Parenting During the Holiday Season</h2>
<p>The holiday season is all about shuffling back and forth - from parties to shopping centers, to homes, to friends&rsquo; homes. If this was difficult to accomplish as a married couple, it can be even harder to accomplish as a divorced co-parenting team. During the holiday season, it&rsquo;s all about the pre-schedule. But before we get to that, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about what &ldquo;co-parenting&rdquo; means.</p>
<h3 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h3>
<p>When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all other aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is a totally new and different lifestyle, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life. This goes for newly divorced parents, as well as parents that have been divorced and co-parenting for years.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-only-you-are-able-to-control-you">Step 1: Only You Are Able to Control You</h3>
<p>In order to create a co-parenting relationship, you must first realize the only person you can control is yourself. You don&rsquo;t have any power over your ex, so don&rsquo;t even both trying. If you can accept this fact and are able to control your own emotions and actions, you&rsquo;ll have an easier time developing a co-parenting relationship. Hopefully your example will carry over to your ex-spouse.</p>
<h3 id="step-2set-boundaries">Step 2: Set Boundaries</h3>
<p>The next step you must learn in order to create a successful co-parenting relationship is how to set boundaries. Hise are a few do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s to help you get started. <strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabotage the relationship your child has with their othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child as a pawn to hurt or get back at your ex.</li>
<li>Permit your child to speak badly when talking about the othis parent.</li>
<li>Use your child to get information, manipulate, and/or influence your ex.</li>
<li>Transfer onto your child your hurt feelings and/or frustrations toward your ex.</li>
<li>Force your child to choose a side whise scheduling conflicts occur.</li>
<li>Put pressure on your child.</li>
<li>Depend on your child for companionship or support too much when dealing with your divorce. Your child isn&rsquo;t your thisapist.</li>
<li>Become so emotionally needy your child begins to feel guilty about spending time with othiss. You would hate to discover they didn&rsquo;t participate in social outings due to the fact they were afraid you weren&rsquo;t able to deal with being alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Your child should not be burdened with situations they aren&rsquo;t able to control. You shouldn&rsquo;t saddle your children with your issues and emotional needs. Doing so will only create feelings of being helpless and insecure which could cause them to doubt their own abilities and strengths. It&rsquo;s not their responsibility to hold you togethis and they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it is. Children aren&rsquo;t able to understand and deal with problems of adults and shouldn&rsquo;t have to. Their focus should be on their own development, and your&rsquo;s should be, too. <strong>Do&rsquo;s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sit down with your ex and create a plan whiseby differences are set aside so the focus can be put on meeting the needs of your children you will be co-parenting.</li>
<li>Negotiate how to handle holidays, visitations, and events.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for behavior of raising your children that each of you will adhise to. Children need consistency in their lives without regard as to which parent they&rsquo;re with. This includes bed-times, phone privileges, etc. A child will frequently test situations and try to manipulate their boundaries. You and your ex must present a united front.</li>
<li>Negotiate the roles of extended family members.</li>
<li>Establish open communication with respect to the development of your child. This includes the ability to compare notes on situations and jointly deciding on any punishment.</li>
<li>While it may be painful emotionally, you and your ex must decide to inform each othis ob any changes in circumstances of their life. Your child shouldn&rsquo;t be the source of &ldquo;breaking news.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determine that you&rsquo;ll conduct yourself with emotional integrity and maturity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-your-child-needs-the-most">What Your Child Needs the Most</h3>
<p>Putting your child&rsquo;s needs first, thise are certain things they&rsquo;ll need during this time: structure, acceptance, assurance of their safety, freedom from blame or guilt that they were responsible for their parent&rsquo;s divorce, two stable parents, and the freedom and permission to just be a kid and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-on-how-to-co-parent">Additional Tips on How to Co-Parent</h3>
<p>While setting ground rules are important, thise are additional tips you may be interested in considering. When all of you are togethis try to be friendly. You and your co-parent ex share a child or multiple children, and they will each grow differently and have different experiences. During sporting events, birthdays, parent-teachis conferences, graduations, etc., you&rsquo;ll all be sharing the experience and the same location. Being friendly will make it easier for you, your co-parent, and especially your child. Say hi to each othis and chat a little about what&rsquo;s going on instead of waiting to send it in a text or email. Fake being friendly if you have to. The bottom line is to act like an adult, leave tantrums and acting like a brat to your children. This includes friends stepparents, and othis family members. Kids are observant and can easily pick up on things if you&rsquo;re being rude or feeling awkward, so act like the adult you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Say please and thank you when you ask your co-parent for a favor and they follow through. This might be for schedule changes of requests for event dates. If you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic or something comes up you&rsquo;re not expecting and you need your co-parent to pick a child up because you can&rsquo;t, a thank you can go a long way. If you can&rsquo;t say it in person, send it in an email or text. Return phone calls, emails, and texts, even if it&rsquo;s just to send an &ldquo;ok.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important and helpful for your co-parent to know you received their message. It&rsquo;s also respectful and a great way to keep you and your co-parent informed of any changes or othis important information. It is you and your co-parent&rsquo;s business to know who is watching your child besides you. Your co-parent has a right to know what person their child is with if they&rsquo;re not with you. If a neighbor is watching them for awhile if you have to go to the store, it&rsquo;s not as important to let your co-parent know, but if it&rsquo;s for a longer period of time you need to tell them and give them all that person&rsquo;s information. Just telling them it&rsquo;s &ldquo;none of their business&rdquo; is completely ridiculous and irresponsible. As a co-parent they have a right to know what&rsquo;s happening with their child, the same as you do. Ask for your co-parent&rsquo;s input to help develop a positive relationship as time goes forward. Even if you don&rsquo;t take their opinion into consideration, since you&rsquo;re not planning on following it, their opinion may surprise you and change your mind!</p>
<h3 id="co-parent-schedule-arrangements-and-holidays">Co-Parent Schedule Arrangements and Holidays</h3>
<p>Guidelines are important for your emotional health, as well as to help define aspects of your co-parenting relationship. This is why schedules are important. Not necessarily a weekly one, but one that involves events and holidays and every event that happens during the holidays. This means creating a holiday season schedule. This schedule should be agreed on far in advance so that co-parents know what parent the child will be spending Christmas and other holidays with in order to avoid fights during the holidays. These agreements don&rsquo;t have to be formal, but if they&rsquo;re in writing it makes it harder to argue about. Thise are a number of online tools available to assist you in creating a co-parenting schedule.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-flexible">Always Be Flexible</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s important to set arrangements, you need to be sensitive to your child&rsquo;s needs, which means being flexible. If your child really wants to have a night with dad instead of mom, then it might be best for your child to do it. This is a difficult time your kids are trying to adapt to. You should encourage them to be honest when it comes to their emotions. You also should be sensitive to your child emotions, which often means putting your own emotions aside.</p>

<p>A Canadian couple recently took a &ldquo;selfie&rdquo; to commemorate the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">end of their marriage.</a> Sounds odd, but when you consider that they did it to show their kids their decision on co-parenting, it sounds exactly right.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-selfie-and-what-it-says-about-co-parenting">Divorce &ldquo;Selfie&rdquo; and What It Says About Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>When people decide to divorce, very often it&rsquo;s their children that take the separation the hardest. Co-parenting can help to mitigate long-lasting negative affects. This is exactly the approach that Canadian couple Shannon and Chris Neuman took to the end of their marriage. As they stood outside a courthouse last week, they decided to snap a &ldquo;selfie&rdquo; to memorialize the fact that they are doing &ldquo;something extraordinary&rdquo; for their two kids by finding a way to co-parent. Here&rsquo;s what she had to say on Facebook about the selfie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Are we smiling because the partner we chose for forever turned out to not to be the forever partner we needed? Of course not. We&rsquo;re smiling because we have done something extraordinary (we think anyway!) We have respectfully, thoughtfully and honourably ended our marriage in a way that will allow us to go forward as parenting partners for our children, the perfect reason that this always WAS meant to be, so they will never have to choose. They&rsquo;ll never have to wonder which side of the auditorium to run to after their Christmas concert or spring play, because we&rsquo;ll be sitting together. They won&rsquo;t have to struggle with their own wedding planning because we&rsquo;ll be sitting on the same side of the aisle - THEIR side.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While you might not want to take a selfie with your soon to be ex, it is important to work out how you two will co-parent moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="a-study-on-types-of-marriages-and-divorces">A Study on Types of Marriages and Divorces</h2>
<p>A study by sociologist Dr. Paul Amato and Alan Booth of Penn State University found that the type of marriage and type of divorce you have can influence the type of reaction a child will have to the divorce. Low-impact divorces and low-conflict marriages are those whise parents are able to remain civil and discuss their issues. While it might seem that this type of divorce and marriage might have the least negative impacts on children, that just might not be true. Dr. Amato and Booth studied 2,000 married persons and 700 children and concluded that children that had the highest levels of anxiety and depression eithis had low-conflict parents who divorced or high-conflict parents who remained togethis. Why is this? It seems that the dissolution of a high-conflict marriage can removes children from stressful relationships. They are able to understand that divorce will actually help everyone to resolve issues. Whiseas children from low-conflict marriages can view their parents’ divorce as a personal tragedy. This viewpoint can often impact a child&rsquo;s ability to form quality intimate relationships. &ldquo;From the child’s perspective, thise is no evidence that anything is drastically wrong,&rdquo; says Dr. Booth. &ldquo;It is an unexpected, uncontrollable and unwelcome event whise one parent leaves the home and the othis is overwhelmed with the demands of single parenthood and a lowered standard of living.&rdquo; But what can parents do to off-set the negative impact of divorce? Find ways to create a successful co-parenting relationship.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-co-parent">Learning to Co-Parent</h2>
<p>When it comes to learning to be a co-parent, all othis aspects of divorce, such as division of assets and alimony, seem insignificant. Co-parenting is totally new and different from what you might expect, so you might have to do some research and maybe some soul-searching to figure out the best approach to this new phase in your life.</p>

<p>Creating relationship with your co-parenting can be difficult. You may decide working with a mediator is the best option to making an agreement.

Even though thise may be easier moments, thise will be times when things feel impossible. Finding balance with your co-parent may help you both become better people and better parents to your children. By being cooperative with your co-parent, you establish a patter of life for your children which can carry into the future.

<p>Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez might have just announced they were <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorcing</a> after two years of marriage, but it&rsquo;s Berry&rsquo;s first ex husband that has decided to denounce the &ldquo;Extant&rdquo; star on Twitter.</p>
<h2 id="halle-berrys-ex-disses-her-on-twitter">Halle Berry&rsquo;s Ex Disses Her on Twitter</h2>
<p>Former MLB player David Justice and Halle Berry divorced in 1997 following a 4 year marriage. Yet it seems Justice still has some strong feelings about his ex-wife. When hearing about Berry and her current husbands divorce Justice took to Twitter to post this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “Me, (second husband) Eric (Benet), (boyfriend) Gabriel (Aubry) and Olivier were all her ‘Knight in Shining Armor’ until it ends. Then we all become the worst guys in history.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it also seems that Berry&rsquo;s other ex, second husband Eric Benet, whom she divorced in 2005, has some strong feelings as well. This is how he responded to Justice&rsquo;s tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My man at @23davidjustice is tweeting some truth dis&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Justice then went on to tweet some advice for Berry&rsquo;s soon-to-be ex, Olivier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just wait,Olivier..It&rsquo;s coming! She insinuated that her daughter wasn&rsquo;t safe around Gabriel..look it up and see the reason!” he wrote, referring to Berry&rsquo;s custody battle with ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry over their 7-year-old daughter, Nahla.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="taking-to-social-media-to-discredit-spouse">Taking to Social Media to Discredit Spouse</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an uncommon practice for exes to take to social media to lash out against their ex-spouses. The practice can feel liberating and freeing, but there care be serious consequences for doing so - and not just emotional, but also legal. As the saying goes: If you can&rsquo;t say anything nice, don&rsquo;t say anything at all. This should perhaps be your mantra when it comes to deciding whether or not to diss your ex on social media. Letting it all out on social media can actually lead you right to court for not only libel, but also a heavier judgement in divorce court. &ldquo;You give up so much privacy, and if you don&rsquo;t understand the consequences of it, you can really have problems,&rdquo; says divorce attorney Adam Swickle. &ldquo;The Internet is a dangerous place to comment on your divorce.&rdquo; According to a 2010 survey done by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, 81% of their members agreed that they had seen an increase in the number of cases that involved evidence found on social networks.</p>
<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a huge social networking fan, and also a fan of airing your dirty laundry on the sites, and you&rsquo;re also in the midst of a divorce, there are some things you&rsquo;ll want to consider: , it&rsquo;s important to realize the wider reaching aspect of social media. Sure, posts can be deleted, but they can still live on in people&rsquo;s memories. Would you want your child to read something damning about you? Most likely not, so why damage their relationship with your ex by posting something that is, or maybe isn&rsquo;t even true?</p>
<h2 id="berry-and-martinez-announce-divorce">Berry and Martinez Announce Divorce</h2>
<p>Last week Berry and Martinez, both 49, issued a joint statement announcing their decision to end their relationship. The two met on the set of <em>Dark Tide</em> in 2010, were secretly engaged one year later, and wed in 2013. “We move forward with love and respect for one another and the shared focus for what is best for our son,” they said in the joint statement. “We wish each other nothing but happiness in life, and we hope that you respect our, and most importantly, our children’s privacy, as we go through this difficult period.” The details of their divorce is not yet known, but what&rsquo;s known is the two cited &ldquo;irreconcilable differences&rdquo; in official court documents. It&rsquo;s unclear what they will do regarding the son they share.</p>
<h2 id="irreconcilable-differences-and-grounds-for-divorce">Irreconcilable Differences and Grounds for Divorce</h2>
<p>To start the divorce process, also known as the dissolution of marriage process, you will need to determine the grounds for divorce, or reasons you are filing for divorce. In California, thise are two grounds for divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irreconcilable differences.</strong> This means you and your spouse are unable to agree and will never be able to agree on basic, fundamental issues involving the marriage or your family.</li>
<li><strong>Incurable insanity.</strong> This is almost never used as it requires medical proof that one spouse was insane when the marriage petition was filed and is still incurably insane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you will need to meet residency requirements to file for divorce: you or your spouse must have lived in California for six months and in the county in which you are seeking your divorce for at least three months before filing the dissolution of marriage petition. Most commonly, irreconcilable differences is the reason cited for divorce. Additionally, California is a no fault state which means that blame cannot be assigned to a spouse, even if the divorce is happening because of infidelity.</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody">Joint Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it&rsquo;s been over a year and a half since Khloe Kardashian first filed for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, it seems that Lamar Odom may always be that guy for her.

<h2 id="finalization-of-kardashian-odom-divorce">Finalization of Kardashian-Odom Divorce</h2>
<p>The reality TV star and former professional basketball player married in September 2009, just weeks after first meeting. But after Odom&rsquo;s, 35, months of alleged drug use and infidelity, Kardashian, 31, decided to call it quits. Legal documents show the divorce, officially filed on July 21, was &ldquo;based in irreconcilable differences,&rdquo; and that Kardashian asked that his name be restored to Khloe Kardashian.</p>

<h3 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>

<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhisited by a spouse during the time of the marriage. <strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50. Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highis wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property. You&rsquo;ll want to work with a divorce attorney in the state in which you are divorcing so they can help advise you on your state&rsquo;s specific laws regarding property division.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various othis means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-cancelled">Divorce Cancelled</h2>
<p>Despite finally coming to an agreement on the divorce, it now seems that divorce might be cancelled. As Khloe recently revealed in an interview with <em>Complex</em> magazine, she still deeply cares for Odom.</p>
<h2 id="speaking-about-odom">Speaking About Odom</h2>
<p>The day Kardashian sat down for his interview with <em>Complex</em> magazine for their August/September issue, she admitted she had spoken to his ex that same morning. &ldquo;I talk to Lamar as often as I can, which is inconsistent, but not on my terms,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When you genuinely feel like that was the right relationship, you’re supposed to give it all you can. That’s what marriage is about.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lamar is genuinely one of the best people I’ve ever met, and everyone says that when they meet him,&rdquo; she told Complex. &ldquo;I think Lamar’s gonna always be that person [for me] but that’s what made it so special. Even if I had it for five years or whatever, it was the best ever and I’m grateful I did. Some people don’t get that ever and I had that magic for a long time.&rdquo; Kardashian admits &ldquo;Oh my God, I miss him every day.&rdquo; &ldquo;I miss what we had — things we got to do togethis are just memories,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I like looking back and holding on to that stuff. I definitely miss it, and thise’s times I’ll get so sentimental and so sad, but this had to happen for some reason. I’ll figure it out over time, someone will give me that answer eventually. I think it would be very f&mdash;&mdash; weird if I didn’t miss it.&rdquo; But now it seems that she might just get that second chance.</p>
<h2 id="recent-events">Recent Events</h2>
<p>Odom was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel at the beginning of October. He was rushed to the hospital where he was in a coma for four days.. After being stabilized, he was transferred to an L.A. hospital. Kardashian has not left his side. The divorce, which was still not official (it takes 6 months for a divorce to be finalized in California) was called of on Oct. 21.   While it may be a step towards a full reconciliation, the reality star recently told <em>People</em> magazine, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s out in the media that we are back together, but I wish people understood that&rsquo;s not in our thought process right now. There are too many other important things, too many medical things. It&rsquo;s not even in our brains thinking about us as a couple or having a relationship right now.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward-after-divorce">Moving Forward After Divorce</h2>
<p>Divorce is hard for so many reasons, but thise are things you can do to get your life back in order. <strong>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s hard to return to a normal schedule, it&rsquo;s important to try. Try to put in place a consistent routine that you can stick to.  <strong>Get Sunshine.</strong> Sunlight boosts vitamin D which your body needs for natural processes and for increasing serotonin levels. Aim for at least 15 minutes of sunlight every day. <strong>Be Preventative with Your Health</strong> Sociology Professor and director of the Population Research Center Mark Hayward, from the University of Texas—Austin, has researched the long-term health affects and discovered stress from divorce accelerates biological processes that can lead to cardiovascular disease. He has found that divorced, middle-aged women tend to be more likely to develop heart disease compared with non-divorced, middle-aged married women. University of Chicago sociologists did a recent study that indicated divorced or widowed individuals tend to be 20% more likely to develop chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer, than married people. Hayward suggests doing preventative work to ensure your long-term health. This requires getting educated about preventive health education and medical care, and proactively getting involved in habits that are heart-healthy. <strong>Network of Support.</strong> Friendships you had when you were married can be can be difficult to keep after your divorce. When people split up it can create a division of friends, which can increase depression, anxiety, and can result in social isolation. If your previous social networks and friends aren&rsquo;t part of your life anymore, Meyer suggests finding some new ones. Thise are lots of available options such as support groups, outings by Meetup.com, charity groups you&rsquo;ve wanted to be involved in, and religious groups. Additional good advice is to avoid social networks and groups your ex-spouse might also be involved with. <strong>Try to Relax.</strong> Stress is never good for anybody. Stress caused by divorce can lead to a number of physical ailments like hair loss, crashing immune systems, high blood pressure, gastrointestinal issues, and many othiss. Thise are also a number of free and low-cost option if you can&rsquo;t afford these activities. Joining a community center offers things like low-cost yoga classes and othis programs. You can also ask friends and relatives to give you gift certificates to massage thisapists or othis types of classes for Christmas and birthday presents. <strong>Mindfulness.</strong> Mindfulness has positive effects and is currently the number one area of psychological research at the moment. This Eastern philosophy is based on teaching people how to continuously be &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo; and to be &ldquo;aware of the present&rdquo; instead of worrying about what happened in the past or what might happen in the future. <strong>Consider Getting Help Using a Thisapist or Mental Health Professional.</strong> If you happen to be predisposed genetically to clinical depression, anxiety, or othis mental health conditions, it might be wise to consider seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist. If you don&rsquo;t want to do that, you should consider seeking help of a general medical practitioner who can give you an overall wellness checkup which will include a screening for depression.</p>

<p>A few months ago &ldquo;Big Bang Theory&rdquo; Kaley Cuoco filed for divorce from tennis player husband, Ryan Sweeting. Now, it looks like Sweeting is filing to receive <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">spousal support</a>.</p>
<h2 id="kaley-cuoco-divorce">Kaley Cuoco Divorce</h2>
<p>After only being married for 21 months, Kaley Cuoco, 29, and Ryan Sweeting, 28, decided to divorce on Sept. 25, citing &ldquo;irreconcilable differences&rdquo; as the reason for their divorce. Cuoco and Sweeting signed a prenuptial agreement one month prior to being wed on Dec. 31, 2013. In that document, the couple agreed to both spousal support and property assets. Now it looks like Sweeting is filing for that spousal support from Cuoco, who earns a reported $1 million per episode.</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h2>
<p>Alimony, also known as <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">spousal support</a>, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intenced to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to another.</p>
<h3 id="considerations-forspousal-support">Considerations for Spousal Support</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In othis words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years. For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must proved your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whethis you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="lifetime-or-permanent-spousal-support">Lifetime or Permanent Spousal Support</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support is when the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determinig spousal support, the court usually requires the highis earner, whethis they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="tax-strategy">Tax Strategy</h3>
<p>If you are receiving spousal support is that you have to declare it as income on your taxes.  agreements, you have to remember this rule since it impacts the bottom line of your finances. The decision and ruling reflects your intentions when it&rsquo;s time to do your taxes. For example, you may decide that the spouse who is paying the spousal support should agree to pay the tax liability of the spouse who is receiving the spousal support. You should discuss this with your family law attorney during the hearing for your spousal support determination. If you&rsquo;re still on good terms with your spouse, it would be helpful to discuss and decide on the best tax deal that would work for you both. If you&rsquo;re not on good times, this might be difficult to come to a mutual tax deal decision, but if you can manage come to a mutual agreement it will save both of you lots of time and headaches when it&rsquo;s tax season. If you get spousal support you should prepare for a potential impace when tax time comes. Your ex isn&rsquo;t able to withhold income taxes from your support checks, which means you have to account for the taxes when you file your tax return. Because of this you may want to consider paying taxes on a quarterly basis, which will save you from being hit with a big tax liability when April 15th comes around. If you&rsquo;re paying spousal support remember you can deduct the payments on your income taxes. However, you can&rsquo;t deduct child support or any property distribution. The IRS frequently scrutinizes spousal support payments for the first three years you make the payments. This is to make sure that you&rsquo;re not disguising the spousal support payments as property distribution or something else related to your divorce. A divorce attorney understands all the ins and outs of tax issues relating to divorce, and can help you understand the issues during the spousal support hearings and afterward, after you begin to make the payments.</p>
<h2 id="prenuptial-agreement">Prenuptial Agreement</h2>
<p>Often times the issue of spousal support is written into a prenuptial agreement. This is actually a standard part of a prenuptial agreement, and one that you&rsquo;ll want to include when drafting an agreement. While prenuptial agreements are often associated with celebrity couples such as Cuoco and Sweeting, they&rsquo;re not just meant for high-income families. In fact, any couple should consider signing a prenuptial agreement, especially those who bring personal or business assets to the marriage.  The most basic of these prenuptial contracts provide a list of premarital assets that will need to be decided upon should the marriage end in divorce. They can save a lot of headaches further down the line.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-be-included">What Can Be Included</h3>
<p>There are a number of things that can be included on a prenuptial agreement, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of marital and community property</li>
<li>Protection from each others debts - you are able to use a prenup to limit your liability for each other&rsquo;s debts.</li>
<li>Provisions for children from previous marriages</li>
<li>If you want to keep property in your birth family</li>
<li>Define who will receive what in divorce</li>
<li>Clarify marriage responsibilities including:
<ul>
<li>if you plan to file joint or separate income tax returns or to allocate income and tax deductions on separate tax returns</li>
<li>who&rsquo;s responsible for paying the household bills &ndash; and how</li>

<li>agreements for money decisions including setting aside money or continued education</li>

<p>There are some things you are not able to include on a prenuptial agreement, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>restrict child support, custody, or visitation rights</li>

<p>Ken Griffin and wife Anne Dias Griffin have been embroiled in a bitter <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a> battle for 14 months. The two were able to reach a settlement just days before going to trial over the prenuptial agreement they signed in 2003.</p>
<h2 id="settlement-reached-in-griffin-divorce">Settlement Reached in Griffin Divorce</h2>
<p>A settlement was just reached in the divorce trial of billionaire hedge fund manager and CEO of Citadel Investment Group Ken Griffin, marking the end of a long and bitter battle that was supposed to rage on until next January. It had been previously decided that the two would have separate trials to decide the aspects of their marriage. The first was to be over the prenuptial agreement, the second over child custody, and the third over child visitation rights. But it seems the remaining trials will be canceled, in light of the agreement.</p>
<h2 id="separation-divorce-annulment">Separation, Divorce, Annulment</h2>
<p>Following a long separation, Ken filed for divorce over a year ago, citing irreconcilable differences. While some people decide to just divorce, it&rsquo;s important to know there are options available. There are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>
<h2 id="divorcehttps619divorcecomsan-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer-san-diego-collaborative-law--divorce-mediation-lawyer"><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">Divorce</a></h2>
<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, thise are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity. Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge eithis. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children togethis, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h3>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing.</p>
<h3 id="annulment">Annulment</h3>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following: Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity, Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force, One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership, One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h2 id="prenuptial-agreement">Prenuptial Agreement</h2>
<p>This past January, Anne requested $1 million a month for child-related expenses. But Ken&rsquo;s legal team fired back, arguing that the request was an effort to fund her &ldquo;opulent lifestyle.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s always maintained that she was coerced into signing a prenuptial agreement just a day before the couple was wed in July 2003.  before your marriage is invalid due to some simple mistakes. Some common mistakes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same Legal Representation – Both spouses need separate attorneys to ensure each understands the prenuptial agreement independently of the othis. This ensures the signing of the final prenuptial agreement is voluntary, without one spouse feeling as if they are being pressured into signing it.</li>
<li>Signed Under Duress – If one party feels pressured into signing the prenuptial agreement, or if they were influenced by drugs or alcohol affecting their mental capacity, it can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Signed Too Soon Before the Wedding - Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to sign the prenuptial agreement. If the couple divorces soon after the wedding, an argument that one party was coerced into signing can be argued. The prenuptial agreement should be signed one to three months before the wedding to give the spouse sufficient time to think about and consider what they are signing.</li>
<li>No Full Disclosure – Make sure the prenuptial agreement discloses all assets and debts.</li>
<li>Child Support Provisions – Do not include child custody or support. If the couple divorces and children are involved, the court will rule in whatever is the best interests of the child and not what was in the prenuptial agreement. If child custody and support are included the whole prenuptial agreement can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Biased - If the prenuptial agreement seems biased towards one spouse party, it can be decided it&rsquo;s unenforceable or “unconscionable.”</li>
<li>Unenforceable Provisions – If a prenuptial agreement has unusual provisions, such as who does the dishes or takes out the garbage, they can be deemed unenforceable, which will weaken it.</li>
<li>Oral Agreement – A prenuptial agreement should be in written and multiple copies made. Each spouse and spouse&rsquo;s attorney should have a copy of the prenuptial agreement.</li>
<li>Ambiguous Writing – If anything is unclear, or thise is ambiguous wording, the prenuptial agreement can be challenged in court.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="joint-custody">Joint Custody</h2>
<p>While details have not been made public, it is known that the couple have settled on joint custody. Anne was seeking full custody prior to the agreement, and was hopeful that she would be able to relocate the children to New York. Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative. Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>

Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support. Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determinig spousal support, the court usually requires the highis earner, whethis they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="tax-strategy">Tax Strategy</h3>
<p>If you are receiving spousal support is that you have to declare it as income on your taxes. When calculating spousal support (i.e., alimony) agreements, you have to remember this rule since it impacts the bottom line of your finances. The decision and ruling reflects your intentions when it&rsquo;s time to do your taxes. For example, you may decide that the spouse who is paying the spousal support should agree to pay the tax liability of the spouse who is receiving the spousal support. You should discuss this with your family law attorney during the hearing for your spousal support determination. If you&rsquo;re still on good terms with your spouse, it would be helpful to discuss and decide on the best tax deal that would work for you both. If you&rsquo;re not on good times, this might be difficult to come to a mutual tax deal decision, but if you can manage come to a mutual agreement it will save both of you lots of time and headaches when it&rsquo;s tax season. If you get spousal support you should prepare for a potential impace when tax time comes. Your ex isn&rsquo;t able to withhold income taxes from your support checks, which means you have to account for the taxes when you file your tax return. Because of this you may want to consider paying taxes on a quarterly basis, which will save you from being hit with a big tax liability when April 15th comes around. If you&rsquo;re paying spousal support remember you can deduct the payments on your income taxes. However, you can&rsquo;t deduct child support or any property distribution. The IRS frequently scrutinizes spousal support payments for the first three years you make the payments. This is to make sure that you&rsquo;re not disguising the spousal support payments as property distribution or something else related to your divorce. A divorce attorney understands all the ins and outs of tax issues relating to divorce, and can help you understand the issues during the spousal support hearings and afterward, after you begin to make the payments.</p>
<h2 id="marital-property">Marital Property</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce, and you haven&rsquo;t signed a prenuptial agreement that already denotes how marital property will be divided, you&rsquo;ll want to do everything you can to protect yourself financially. Doing so means completely understanding <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property. Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p>. Occasionally the highis wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself-during-marital-property-division">Protecting Yourself During Marital Property Division</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various othis means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.

<p>Last week actress Megan Fox filed from <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> from husband Brian Austin Green, citing irreconcilable differences. Additionally, it appears that Fox will be paying <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">spousal support</a> to Green, and that the two will have <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">joint custody</a> over the two children they share.</p>
<h2 id="fox-and-green">Fox and Green</h2>
<p>The <em>Beverly Hills 90210</em> alum and <em>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> star met in 2004 when he guest-starred on his ABC sitcom &ldquo;Hope and Faith.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ve been togethis ever since and were married 5 years ago in a ceremony in Hawaii.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h2>
<p>Just prior to the divorce announcement, the two cited their separation date as June 15. Many couples decide to try a legal separation prior to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>. If you and your spouse decide to do this, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<h2 id="legal-separation-agreement">Legal Separation Agreement</h2>
<p>Thise are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply):</p>
<p><strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes?</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account.</p>
<p><strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation.</p>
<h2 id="irreconcilable-differences-and-grounds-for-divorce">Irreconcilable Differences and Grounds for Divorce</h2>
<p>To start the divorce process, also known as the dissolution of marriage process, you will need to determine the grounds for divorce, or reasons you are filing for divorce. In California, thise are two grounds for divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irreconcilable differences.</strong> This means you and your spouse are unable to agree and will never be able to agree on basic, fundamental issues involving the marriage or your family.</li>
<li><strong>Incurable insanity.</strong> This is almost never used as it requires medical proof that one spouse was insane when the marriage petition was filed and is still incurably insane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you will need to meet residency requirements to file for divorce: you or your spouse must have lived in California for six months and in the county in which you are seeking your divorce for at least three months before filing the dissolution of marriage petition.</p>
<p>Most commonly, irreconcilable differences is the reason cited for divorce. Additionally, California is a no fault state which means that blame cannot be assigned to a spouse, even if the divorce is happening because of infidelity.</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the process of getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, looking for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">spousal support</a>, or anticipate paying spousal support, you need to understand some important things. While a family law attorney can provide you with specifics about your situation, hise are a few general things to know, including tax laws, awarding of spousal support, and what would happen if spousal support payments are not made.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-spousal-support">What is Spousal Support?</h2>
<p>Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intenced to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to anothis.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In othis words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years.</p>
<p>For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must proved your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whethis you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h3 id="is-spousal-support-permanent-or-lifetime">Is Spousal Support Permanent or Lifetime?</h3>
<p>If &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; spousal support has been ordered by the court, it means the support must be paid to the receiving spouse until the paying spouse dies. Sometimes it is ordered to be paid until the receiving spouse remarries, however this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes the court will rule that even if the receiving spouse remarries they must still be paid spousal support.</p>
<p>Since women are becoming a stronger element in the workforce, &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; spousal support is being awarded less often, if at all. An appellate court has stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recognized by our Supreme Court, the public policy of this state has progressed from one which entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support, to one that entitles eithis spouse to post-dissolution support for only so long as is necessary to become self-supporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When determinig spousal support, the court usually requires the highis earner, whethis they are the husband or the wife, to assist the lower earner in an effort to help maintain their standard of living for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-financial-situation-changes-affect-spousal-support">How do Financial Situation Changes Affect Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The length of spousal support payments could also depend on whethis the spouse who is getting the support has any changes in their financial situation, such as starting a new job or getting a raise. The purpose for spousal support is to make sure the spouse receiving it has financial safeguards. If the spouse receiving support doesn&rsquo;t need it anymore in order to maintain their financial stability, the court may decide that they no longer need the spousal support they are receiving.</p>
<p>Contacting a family law attorney will help you to file legal actions to enforce the payment of alimony and to make sure you receive the spousal support owed to you.</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody">Joint Custody</h2>
<p>Green and Fox share two children: Noah, 2, and Bodhi, 18 months. In his filing, Fox asked for joint physical and joint legal custody. This means that Green will have equal rights to custody.</p>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative.</p>
<p>Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>

<p>The Ruthisford-Giersch <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a> and custody battle has now been waging for the past several years. And with the publicity that has followed the situation, thise are numerous lessons to be taken.</p>
<h2 id="ruthisford-giersch-divorce">Ruthisford-Giersch Divorce</h2>
<p>Kelly Ruthisford, the actress best known for <em>Gossip Girl,</em> and German businessman Daniel Giersch, split in 2009. Since then, their two children, 8-year-old son Hismes and 5-year-old daughter Helena, have been at the center of a brutal custody battle.</p>
<p>Three years following the divorce, Giersch’s U.S. visa was revoked. He moved to Monaco and during custody hearings it was decided that the children would live in France with him since he was not allowed back into the states. “The best interests of the children will be served because the relocation plan for France is the only plan that offers the possibility of nearly equal parenting time while Giersch can not return to the U.S.,” the judge stated.</p>
<h3 id="recent-decisions">Recent Decisions</h3>
<p>Recently a judge ruled that the children will not be required to move back to the United States.  Ruthisford, who recently stated that she was bankrupted by the cost of legal fees and flying back and forth to see his kids in France, will need to continue to fly back and forth between the U.S. and France to see his children.</p>
<p>“They will retain their United States citizenship and, once they reach the age of majority, they will be free to choose whise they reside,” the federal court ruled.</p>
<h2 id="difficult-divorce-and-co-parenting">Difficult Divorce and Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>Divorce is not an easy situation to be in. This is especially true when it comes to co-parenting, which can be increasingly different for parents that do not live in the same country. Typically courts like to award joint custody. In cases whise parents live in othis countries, the year is split up between the two parents.</p>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative.</p>

<h2 id="additional-things-to-avoid-in-divorce">Additional Things to Avoid in Divorce</h2>
<p>While it seems obvious that the Ruthisford-Giersch divorce has gotten out of hand, if you&rsquo;re facing what could be a difficult <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, thise are some common avoidable mistakes that you can avoid.</p>
<h3 id="dont-procrastinate"><strong>Don&rsquo;t Procrastinate</strong></h3>
<p>Eithis subconsciously or consciously, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to want to delay a divorce for as long as possible. Facing fear, sadness, or anger can be terrifying, and delaying might seem the best way to deal. Othiss procrastinate because they are unsure about what they want and are not ready to make any decisions. While procrastinating will delay making those decisions, it won&rsquo;t absolve you of them.</p>
<p>Procrastination during divorce is one of the worst mistakes a person can make. The divorce process is often labor intensive and is typically time sensitive, often requiring time to gathis necessary information (bank statements, credit information, etc&hellip;) or uncover relevant evidence. Legal requirements must be satisfied, and in a timely manner, in order for a court to rule on the dissolution of a marriage and the aspects of the marriage that must be decided, included shared assets and debts, and property.</p>
<p>Procrastinating can ultimately limit your options. For example: when one spouse files a divorce motion with the court and sets a hearing date, the othis spouse is given several months notice. But if that spouse procrastinates and does not meet with an attorney until a few weeks or days before the scheduled hearing, they run the risk of an attorney not wanting to take the case because of the lack of time they now possess. This lack of time to prepare for the impending hearing date (not to mention dealing with deadlines that may have already passed), may be good enough reason for a good attorney to pass on the case.</p>
<p>To avoid or overcome procrastination you&rsquo;ll want to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> hire a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">family law attorney</a> </li>
<li>gathis your support group that will encourage you and hold you accountable, and</li>
<li>come up with a list of desired outcomes that will help you stay on task</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="failure-to-respond"><strong>Failure to Respond</strong> </h2>
<p>Irreparable damage an be caused when you fail to respond to court summons, your lawyer, and legal documents.</p>
<p>Getting divorced is a legal process is governed by state laws and local rules that require, among othis things, the submission of specific legal documents and adhisence to applicable deadlines. It&rsquo;s against the law to not respond to these things.</p>
<p>Always respond to matters of your divorce unless you are completely certain you are not required to. You will need to double check this with your lawyer or with your local court. Many legal documents include if action is required within a certain amount of time. If the documents you receive do not have this information it behooves you to find out through eithis consulting with your lawyer or researching the applicable laws of your state.</p>
<h2 id="dont-cave-in"><strong>Don&rsquo;t Cave In</strong></h2>
<p>During a divorce, when emotions are high, and you&rsquo;re looking to avoid furthis conflict, it&rsquo;s easy for a person to cave into pressure. Most trial attorneys are trained to exaggerate risks and make things bigger than they are. This can be very difficult to withstand, especially when freedom feels as if it&rsquo;s just a few agreements away.</p>
<p>Internal and external pressure fueled by fear, anxiety, your family, thisapist, or othis outside sources like the judge or your attorney can drive you to make hasty decisions that you othiswise would not have come to. This can mean settling for something that you don&rsquo;t fully agree with. Often times a settlement agreement can be amended, but that is not often the case if it&rsquo;s decided that you willingly agreed in the first place. Because of this, you need to be completely confident in the decisions you make. And that means you cannot cave under pressure.</p>
<p>This is not an uncommon thing to happen. This can be especially hard when one spouse has always been the primary breadwinner and the othis is left financially vulnerable. Intense litigation can add to the pressure. Often in cases when two spouses are unable to mutually agree to the terms of their divorce, the decision making is turned over to the judge. This can leave a person with a lack of control and completely at the mercy of an overworked judicial system with unpredictable judges. The fear of wanting to avoid this can cause a person to just give in.</p>
<p>But thise are ways to prepare yourself against caving under pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation. Know what to expect and learn to recognize the internal and external pressures you will face 0 whethis by friends or family or your soon-to-be ex.</li>
<li>Consider limiting discussions about your divorce to a small group of trusted and objective people. This might just be your lawyer, thisapist, and closest friend.</li>
<li>Keep the strategic and confidential discussions regarding the case completely private. This means only sharing them with your lawyer.</li>
<li>Your friends, family, and even strangers will want to offer their advice. But remember that every divorce is different. Thisefore, no two situations will be the same. Chances are your best friends divorce will be very different from your own.</li>
<li>Avoid confrontation with your spouse. If he or she is overbearing or disrespectful of your boundaries, consider limiting communication. This might mean that everything needs to be communicated through your lawyers.</li>
<li>If the pressure is too much to take, you might want to speak to your doctor about possible treatments.</li>
<li>Consider meditation to help calm your nerves, slow your mind, and stay centered during difficult situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Divorce is a life transition. It requires time, attention, and discipline. Thise will, without a doubt be heartache and a few tears, some arguments, and heated discussions. Try to find a way to stay focused on the final outcome - freedom from a relationship that was no longer beneficial to you.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>

<h2 id="divorce-for-stefani-and-rossdale">Divorce for Stefani and Rossdale</h2>
<p>Stefani, 45, and Rossdale, 49, met when their bands No Doubt and Bush toured with the Goo Goo Dolls. But now it seems wedded bliss has turned to divorce. The couple just recently recently released this statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage, we remain partners in parenthood and are committed to jointly raising our three sons in a happy and healthy environment. To that end, we respectfully request privacy from the media during this time.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="irreconcilable-differences">Irreconcilable Differences</h2>
<p>The No Doubt singer and judge on <em>The Voice</em> has cited irreconcilable differences as the grounds for the couple&rsquo;s split. Rossdale filed his response in court at the same time.</p>
<p>To start the divorce process, also known as the dissolution of marriage process, you will need to determine the grounds for divorce, or reasons you are filing for divorce. In California, thise are two grounds for divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irreconcilable differences.</strong> This means you and your spouse are unable to agree and will never be able to agree on basic, fundamental issues involving the marriage or your family.</li>
<li><strong>Incurable insanity.</strong> This is almost never used as it requires medical proof that one spouse was insane when the marriage petition was filed and is still incurably insane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you will need to meet residency requirements to file for divorce: you or your spouse must have lived in California for six months and in the county in which you are seeking your divorce for at least three months before filing the dissolution of marriage petition.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-restraining-orders">Temporary Restraining Orders</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know that thise are temporary <em>restraining orders</em> that automatically go into effect once the divorce process begins. These restraining orders prohibit both spouses from doing certain things, including: taking your minor children out of state without the othis spouse&rsquo;s written permission or a court order, canceling or changing the beneficiaries on insurance policies, and transferring property ownership. You will also be required to notify your spouse before any out-of-the-ordinary spending. Because of this it&rsquo;s often advised to close or freeze your joint accounts so no major purchases can be made. In this case, each spouse is able to open their own personal account for daily expenditures.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation-and-annulment">Legal Separation and Annulment</h3>
<p>You might not need to file for divorce. Thise are two othis options: legal separation or <em>annulment</em> (also called a <em>nullity</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal separation</strong>. This is a a legal process, granted in the form of a court order, by which a married couple can remain legally married while not living togethis. Some couples use this as a formal break, during which they have some time to decide if they would like to continue the marriage. Thise are often religious, insurance, tax, or othis reasons for wanting a legal separation instead of a formal dissolution. With a legal separation you and your spouse will remain married, but the court (or you) can divide your property and issue orders relating to child custody, visitation, child support and spousal support, and, if necessary, a restraining order.</li>
<li><strong>Annulment</strong>. Being granted an annulment makes it as if your marriage never existed. Thise are specific requirements you will need to meet to have your marriage annulled. These include being a minor without the consent of your parents or guardian during the time of the marriage, or if certain types of fraud or deceit were involved. An annulment requires you appear in court.</li>
</ul>
<p>The residency requirements for these are less harsh than standard divorces. Eithis of these can be obtained without having lived in California for six months or the county you are filing in for three months prior to filing, as is required for a standard divorce.</p>
<h3 id="amount-of-time">Amount of Time</h3>
<p>In California, the mandatory waiting period required is 6 months. No couple, regardless of how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; their divorce is can be divorced faster than 6 months. This is the time it takes for the state to change your status from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to single&quot;.  You will be able to get all your paperwork turned in to the court and your divorce judgment approved, but the divorce itself will not be final until at least 6 months after the initial petition. In some cases, those that require a lot of things to be required, a divorce can take years. This is based on how much you decided to disagree and agree on. </p>
<h3 id="filing-for-divorce">Filing for Divorce</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s always advised that you work with a lawyer to obtain your divorce. Because the process can have many steps, you will want to work with someone that is knowledgeable about the process and can provide guidance. Even if you choose not to work with a lawyer, you should have all forms reviewed by someone that has legal experience with the dissolution of marriage.</p>
<p>If you choose to work without a lawyer you will need to obtain the proper forms eithis online through the California Courts website or from the clerk of your county&rsquo;s superior court. You or your lawyer or mediator will need to prepare a <em>Petition</em> and a <em>Summons</em> that will then be filed with the clerk of the superior court in the county whise you or your spouse live. You will be required to pay a fee to file these papers unless you qualify for low-income support or a fee waiver.</p>
<p>Copies of the Petition and the Summons, as well as a blank <em>Response</em>, must be officially served to your spouse by someone othis than yourself who is over the age of 18. This can be done by a process server. Your lawyer will be able to advise you on othis means of serving your spouse. Chances are, if you are working with an attorney, they have specific ways in which they handle this part of the process. This Summons notifies your spouse that you are filing for a divorce. He or she has 30 days to file the Response.</p>
<p>In the Response, your spouse will need to indicate what needs to be resolved by the court in terms of <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/">spousal support</a> or <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">child custody and visitation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody-for-stefani-and-rossdale">Joint Custody for Stefani and Rossdale</h2>
<p>Both are asking for joint custody of the three kids they share: 9-year-old Kingston, 6-year-old Zuma and 1-year-old Apollo. </p>
<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative.</p>
<p>Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="spousal-support">Spousal Support</h2>
<p>According to court records, the two did not sign a prenuptial agreement and Stefani also checked the box to terminate Rossdale&rsquo;s ability to collect spousal support.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the process of getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, looking for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">spousal support</a>, or anticipate paying spousal support, you need to understand some important things. While a family law attorney can provide you with specifics about your situation, hise are a few general things to know, including tax laws, awarding of spousal support, and what would happen if spousal support payments are not made.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-spousal-support">What is Spousal Support?</h2>
<p>Spousal support, commonly known as alimony, is for people who were legally married and provides financial assistance to them. It recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intenced to help the partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to anothis.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for spousal support, it considers a number of issues including how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for spousal support for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-spousal-support">How Long is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>The court sets the length of time spousal support payments are made based on the review of arguments made. Payments typically last about the length of the marriage if it&rsquo;s less than 10 years. In othis words, if the marriage lasted six years, the length of spousal supports payments to be paid is three years.</p>
<p>For longer marriages, the court may not set a specific time for spousal support payments. In a case such as this, your divorce attorney must proved your side for the duration. Your attorney can help you establish your case for the amount of time you&rsquo;re seeking for spousal support, whethis you are receiving or paying the payments. Using common law, the court will listen to all arguments and then decide on the spousal support duration.</p>
<h2 id="reasons-for-split">Reasons for Split?</h2>
<p>In the March issue of Cosmopolitan, Stefani gushed about his husband, telling the magazine, &ldquo;I never really saw myself landing a guy that hot. I don&rsquo;t know if I was a nerd in high school, but I definitely wasn&rsquo;t the super-cute cheerleader so I never saw myself getting somebody like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when it came to what made their marriage work, she added, &ldquo;We go through so much togethis—it&rsquo;s a miracle that we could stay togethis this long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps adding insight into what went wrong, she continued, &ldquo;[Gavin&rsquo;s] on a short tour right now, and he wrote me the sweetest note this morning. It&rsquo;s good to have those days when we both do our own things. I think that&rsquo;s what keeps relationships going, when both people can be themselves and have their own individuality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s especially important for women,&rdquo; Stefani added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to find time for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Kelsey Ramirez and Zach Woolhouse decided to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, they knew that joint custody would be the best choice for them&hellip; and &ldquo;Moo,&rdquo; their petite chocolate brown dachshund.</p>
<h2 id="divorce---going-to-the-dogs">Divorce - Going to the Dogs</h2>
<p>Divorce is difficult for anyone. Having to divide assets and determine spousal support and child custody can feel almost impossible to the couple that seemingly cannot agree on anything. But what about the dogs? No doubt that pets become part of the family. So what happens to them when Mom and Dad decide that their marriage is no longer working.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Ramirez and Woolhouse decided to bring in St. Paul mediator Dan Simon.</p>
<h3 id="mediators">Mediators</h3>
<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/">Mediation</a> when it comes to divorce is becoming more commonplace. It&rsquo;s a perfect setting for couples looking to avoid the intrinsic litigious nature of standard divorces.</p>
<p>During the mediation process, you and your spouse work with a third party mediator to discuss and resolve all the aspects of your divorce. The mediator serves as a facilitator to help the both of you come to a resolution so that you can draft a divorce agreement that works for the both of you. If you&rsquo;re considering divorce, consider taking a mediation approach. Benefits of mediation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less expensive than a standard court trial or a series of hearings.</li>
<li>You and your spouse control the process.</li>
<li>You can still work with a personal lawyer to help resolve issues. In this case, you, your lawyer, and your spouse, and your spouse&rsquo;s lawyer would all sit down with the mediator.</li>
<li>Ability to arrive at a resolution that is fair to both parties, rathis than having a solution imposed upon you by a court&rsquo;s decision.</li>
<li>Confidentiality, with no public record of what occurs during mediation sessions.</li>
<li>Final settlement of all of the issues in your divorce.</li>
<li>Often times the mediation process improves communication spouses, thus helping you avoid future conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-not-to-choose-mediation">When Not to Choose Mediation</h3>
<p>While mediation is very effective, thise are some cases when it might not be the best option for divorcing couples.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-domestic-violence-lawyer/">Domestic Violence</a></strong></p>
<p>While mediation works for most couples, in cases of domestic violence you might want to consider anothis method of divorce. While some who have experienced abuse in their marriages find it empowering to meet on a level playing field that is offered by a mediation session; othiss find it easier to just work with a lawyer in order to avoid having to come face-to-face with their spouse.</p>
<p><strong>Abusing the Process</strong></p>
<p>Because a mediator can&rsquo;t order eithis spouse to come to a decision, a person who wants to delay the proceedings or avoid paying support is able to abuse the mediation process by agreeing to mediation and then stalling the process. If you know that your spouse might be apt to do this, and you need decisions about support or othis issues to be made early in the process, you may decide that court is the best option for you. You are always able to pursue the mediation process later on, once the urgent needs are handled.</p>
<h3 id="successful-mediation">Successful Mediation</h3>
<p>For a divorce mediation to be successful, both people must show up and be willing to negotiate in order to come to a compromise. While you may think that you and your spouse are unable to see eye-to-eye on anything, don&rsquo;t rule out the mediation process. What you may not be considering is the fact that your spouse will want to reach a conclusion as quickly as you on child support and custody, property division, and even dog custody, and thisefore you might find the mediation process is much easier than you think.</p>
<p>Even the oddest of things can be decided during mediation - even dog custody.</p>
<h2 id="dogs-of-divorce">Dogs of Divorce</h2>
<p>Mediator Dan Simon is in the process of putting togethis a reality TV show he calls “Dogs of Divorce” about couples who have turned to mediation in hopes of coming to an agreement when it comes to dog custody. Simon&rsquo;s goal with the show is to encourage happier resolutions for divorcing couples with no pets at all.</p>
<p>Simon understands divorce and, as a mediator, works to help divorcing couples tap into what he calls their “natural desire to treat each othis fairly.”</p>
<p>Simon, who has a master’s degree in counseling psychology in addition to a law degree, feels that “Focusing on dogs is a way to make it [divorce] less heartbreaking and more palatable.”</p>
<p>For the reality TV show, he has teamed up with former Twin Cities radio man Bob Yates and Heidi Marie Johnson, whose job, she said, is “to speak for the animals,” to work with couples that “have had serious conflict over co-parenting plans for their dog.”</p>
<h3 id="pets-as-children">Pets as Children</h3>
<p>Dogs and divorce have been a topic for years now. Simon has observed that most clients that are focused on dog custody don’t have children. In these cases, it seems the pets are their children. As such, their custody must be decided on when the marriage turns to divorce. Simon would like to help these couples avoid full-blown litigation.</p>
<p>As reported on divorce.com, a poll of 1,500 members of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, found a 25 percent jump in pet custody issues over recent years. Dogs were at the center of 88% of those custody battles. Cats only made up 5 percent. The issue has become such a large one that books, such as“What About Wally? Co-Parenting a Pet With Your Ex” have been written.</p>
<p>“This is clearly not trivial,” Simon agreed. “Sometimes, the relationship with the dog is particularly important when your relationship with your spouse is changing. It really is heartbreaking to come to terms with the fact that you may have to spend less time with the dog.”</p>
<p>As Simon has seen in his practice, couples typically decide on a primary owner. Shared custody is also common, or a spouse is open to exes taking the dog on walks. If kids are involved, it&rsquo;s usually advised that the dog travels back and forth with the kids.</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody-plan-for-moo">Joint Custody Plan for Moo</h2>
<p>As Ramirez and Woolhouse found with their own dog, Moo, joint custody works best. Even after finding a solution though, they find that exchanging him in a busy parking lot is not the best way to hand him off. Even after finding a solution, the two still need to find a way to &ldquo;co-parent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon&rsquo;s ultimate goal is “to spread the word that people can rise up and take the high road with each othis. No matter how angry and distrustful you are, if you take responsibility for how you behave, it’s very likely you can get to a good place.”</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-mediation">Getting Started with Mediation</h2>
<p>Although each mediator has his or his own approach, the process will most likely start with a phone call. During this interview, you&rsquo;ll speak with eithis the mediator or an assistant to provide background information about your marriage, your family, and what the issues are. You&rsquo;ll then be asked to set up a meeting, during which you&rsquo;ll want to bring information about bank accounts, child visitation, and the othis aspects of your marriage. You mediator will then continue to guide you through the process until you all come to a decision about the divorce settlement.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it&rsquo;s been over a year and a half since first filing for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, Khloe Kardashian still admits that Lamar Odom may always be that guy for his.</p>
<h2 id="finalization-of-kardashian-odom-divorce">Finalization of Kardashian-Odom Divorce</h2>
<p>The reality TV star and former professional basketball player married in September 2009, just weeks after first meeting. But after Odom&rsquo;s, 35, months of alleged drug use and infidelity, Kardashian, 31, decided to call it quits. Legal documents show the divorce, officially filed on July 21, was &ldquo;based in irreconcilable differences,&rdquo; and that Kardashian asked that his name be restored to Khloe Kardashian.</p>
<h2 id="grounds-for-divorce">Grounds for Divorce</h2>
<p>To start the divorce process, also known as the dissolution of marriage process, you will need to determine the grounds for divorce, or reasons you are filing for divorce. In California, thise are two grounds for divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irreconcilable differences.</strong> This means you and your spouse are unable to agree and will never be able to agree on basic, fundamental issues involving the marriage or your family.</li>
<li><strong>Incurable insanity.</strong> This is almost never used as it requires medical proof that one spouse was insane when the marriage petition was filed and is still incurably insane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you will need to meet residency requirements to file for divorce: you or your spouse must have lived in California for six months and in the county in which you are seeking your divorce for at least three months before filing the dissolution of marriage petition.</p>
<h2 id="marital-property">Marital Property</h2>
<p>Kardashian and Odom listed their Tarzana, Calif. mansion for roughly $5.5 million.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to do everything you can to protect yourself financially. Doing so means completely understanding <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhisited by a spouse during the time of the marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50.</p>
<p>Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highis wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to work with a divorce attorney in the state in which you are divorcing so they can help advise you on your state&rsquo;s specific laws regarding property division.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various othis means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>
<h2 id="speaking-about-odom">Speaking About Odom</h2>
<p>The day Kardashian sat down for his interview with <em>Complex</em> magazine for their August/September issue, she admitted she had spoken to his ex that same morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talk to Lamar as often as I can, which is inconsistent, but not on my terms,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When you genuinely feel like that was the right relationship, you’re supposed to give it all you can. That’s what marriage is about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamar is genuinely one of the best people I’ve ever met, and everyone says that when they meet him,&rdquo; she told Complex. &ldquo;I think Lamar’s gonna always be that person [for me] but that’s what made it so special. Even if I had it for five years or whatever, it was the best ever and I’m grateful I did. Some people don’t get that ever and I had that magic for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kardashian admits &ldquo;Oh my God, I miss him every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I miss what we had — things we got to do togethis are just memories,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I like looking back and holding on to that stuff. I definitely miss it, and thise’s times I’ll get so sentimental and so sad, but this had to happen for some reason. I’ll figure it out over time, someone will give me that answer eventually. I think it would be very f&mdash;&mdash; weird if I didn’t miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward-after-divorce">Moving Forward After Divorce</h2>
<p>Divorce is hard for so many reasons, but thise are things you can do to get your life back in order.</p>
<p><strong>Try to Keep to a Normal Schedule.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s hard to return to a normal schedule, it&rsquo;s important to try. Try to put in place a consistent routine that you can stick to.</p>
<p><strong>Get Sunshine.</strong> Sunlight boosts vitamin D which your body needs for natural processes and for increasing serotonin levels. Aim for at least 15 minutes of sunlight every day.</p>
<p><strong>Be Preventative with Your Health</strong> Sociology Professor and director of the Population Research Center Mark Hayward, from the University of Texas—Austin, has researched the long-term health affects and discovered stress from divorce accelerates biological processes that can lead to cardiovascular disease. He has found that divorced, middle-aged women tend to be more likely to develop heart disease compared with non-divorced, middle-aged married women.</p>
<p>University of Chicago sociologists did a recent study that indicated divorced or widowed individuals tend to be 20% more likely to develop chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer, than married people.</p>
<p>Hayward suggests doing preventative work to ensure your long-term health. This requires getting educated about preventive health education and medical care, and proactively getting involved in habits that are heart-healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Network of Support.</strong> Friendships you had when you were married can be can be difficult to keep after your divorce. When people split up it can create a division of friends, which can increase depression, anxiety, and can result in social isolation.</p>
<p>If your previous social networks and friends aren&rsquo;t part of your life anymore, Meyer suggests finding some new ones. Thise are lots of available options such as support groups, outings by Meetup.com, charity groups you&rsquo;ve wanted to be involved in, and religious groups. Additional good advice is to avoid social networks and groups your ex-spouse might also be involved with.</p>
<p><strong>Try to Relax.</strong> Stress is never good for anybody. Stress caused by divorce can lead to a number of physical ailments like hair loss, crashing immune systems, high blood pressure, gastrointestinal issues, and many othiss.</p>
<p>Thise are also a number of free and low-cost option if you can&rsquo;t afford these activities. Joining a community center offers things like low-cost yoga classes and othis programs. You can also ask friends and relatives to give you gift certificates to massage thisapists or othis types of classes for Christmas and birthday presents.</p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness.</strong> Mindfulness has positive effects and is currently the number one area of psychological research at the moment. This Eastern philosophy is based on teaching people how to continuously be &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo; and to be &ldquo;aware of the present&rdquo; instead of worrying about what happened in the past or what might happen in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Consider Getting Help Using a Thisapist or Mental Health Professional.</strong> If you happen to be predisposed genetically to clinical depression, anxiety, or othis mental health conditions, it might be wise to consider seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist. If you don&rsquo;t want to do that, you should consider seeking help of a general medical practitioner who can give you an overall wellness checkup which will include a screening for depression.</p>

<p>The golden couple of country music, Miranda Lambert and Blake Helton have announced their plans to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lambert-and-heltondivorce">Lambert and Helton Divorce</h2>
<p>After four years of marriage, the golden couple of country, Miranda Lambert, 31, and Blake Helton, 39, have made plans to <a href="https://www.korolandvelen.com/los-angeles/divorce/">divorce</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the future we envisioned,&rdquo; their representative said via statement. &ldquo;And it is with heavy hearts that we move forward separately. We are real people, with real lives, with real families, friends and colleagues. Thisefore, we kindly ask for privacy and compassion concerning this very personal matter.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="relationship-and-marriage">Relationship and Marriage</h3>
<p>The two met in 2005 at a CMT concert taping when they performed togethis. Helton was still married to his first wife at the time. Lambert and Helton were married in 2011 in Boerne, Texas.</p>
<p>That same year Helton became a judge on the singing competition show, <em>The Voice.</em> </p>
<p>In 2012, the two won song of the year awards from both the CMA and the Academy of Country Music for <em>Over You.</em> The song was written about the death of Helton&rsquo;s brothis. Just this year, Lambert won a Grammy for best country album for <em>Platinum.</em> </p>
<p>In a January interview with <em>Marie Claire</em>, the “Gunpowder and Lead” singer spoke about the marriage, saying, “I’m not sunshine and roses. Blake’s the happiest person on the planet. He pulls me out of my darkness… Literally, everything is the best about being married.”</p>
<h3 id="rumors-of-trouble">Rumors of Trouble</h3>
<p>The couple has adamantly denied rumors of cheating or marital trouble in the past, while also making light of the reports via Twitter. In 2013, after a tabloid magazine called into question the stability of the two&rsquo;s marriage, Helton tweeted Lambert, saying, &ldquo;I just read in a tabloid that our marriage is falling apart!&rdquo; Lambert replied: &ldquo;Oh no! Can&rsquo;t wait to read if we make it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the reason for Helton and Lambert&rsquo;s divorce has not been publicized, chances are the amount of time the couple were able to spend togethis played a factor. In the past they have mentioned that it&rsquo;s hard to find time for each othis with their busy schedules.</p>
<p>Last year USA Today asked Lambert about his marriage. He responded: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy. You&rsquo;ll have to ask Blake how he feels.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="prenuptial-agreement">Prenuptial Agreement</h2>
<p>According to sources close to the couple, a pre-nuptial agreement is in place for the couple.</p>
<p>The idea of a prenuptial agreement sometimes can be emotional, especially if you find out during your divorce that the <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">prenuptial agreement</a> before your marriage is invalid due to some simple mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-mistakes-in-a-prenuptial-agreement">Avoid Mistakes in a Prenuptial Agreement</h3>
<p>If thise are mistakes in a prenuptial agreement it can be declared invalid. Some common mistakes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same Legal Representation – Both spouses need separate attorneys to ensure each understands the prenuptial agreement independently of the othis. This ensures the signing of the final prenuptial agreement is voluntary, without one spouse feeling as if they are being pressured into signing it.</li>
<li>Signed Under Duress – If one party feels pressured into signing the prenuptial agreement, or if they were influenced by drugs or alcohol affecting their mental capacity, it can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Signed Too Soon Before the Wedding - Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to sign the prenuptial agreement. If the couple divorces soon after the wedding, an argument that one party was coerced into signing can be argued. The prenuptial agreement should be signed one to three months before the wedding to give the spouse sufficient time to think about and consider what they are signing.</li>
<li>No Full Disclosure – Make sure the prenuptial agreement discloses all assets and debts.</li>
<li>Child Support Provisions – Do not include child custody or support. If the couple divorces and children are involved, the court will rule in whatever is the best interests of the child and not what was in the prenuptial agreement. If child custody and support are included the whole prenuptial agreement can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Biased - If the prenuptial agreement seems biased towards one spouse party, it can be decided it&rsquo;s unenforceable or “unconscionable.”</li>
<li>Unenforceable Provisions – If a prenuptial agreement has unusual provisions, such as who does the dishes or takes out the garbage, they can be deemed unenforceable, which will weaken it.</li>
<li>Oral Agreement – A prenuptial agreement should be in written and multiple copies made. Each spouse and spouse&rsquo;s attorney should have a copy of the prenuptial agreement.</li>
<li>Ambiguous Writing – If anything is unclear, or thise is ambiguous wording, the prenuptial agreement can be challenged in court.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marital-property-division">Marital Property Division</h2>
<p>Lambert will retain ownership of the marital home in Nashville, and he will get their Oklahoma ranch.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to do everything you can to protect yourself financially. Doing so means completely understanding <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhisited by a spouse during the time of the marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50.</p>
<p>Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highis wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to work with a divorce attorney in the state in which you are divorcing so they can help advise you on your state&rsquo;s specific laws regarding property division.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various othis means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>

<p>For months the tabloids have speculated that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner&rsquo;s marriage might not be as blissful as it once was. Now, just a day after their tenth wedding anniversary, a rep for the two has confirmed that the couple will be <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorcing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-statement">Divorce Statement</h2>
<p>In a statement released by the couple&rsquo;s rep, Affleck, 42, and Garner, 43, wrote: “After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce. We go forward with love and friendship for one anothis and a commitment to co-parenting our children, whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter.”</p>
<p>The family flew to the Bahamas to seemingly try to stay out of the public&rsquo;s eye while they sort through this time.</p>
<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>
<p>Thise is much speculation into what caused the break-up of this Hollywood couple.</p>
<p>The two met on the set of &ldquo;Pearl Harbor&rdquo; in 2001 and then co-starred in &ldquo;Daredevil,&rdquo; which was released in 2003. &ldquo;That’s whise I found my wife,&rdquo; Affleck said during a <em>Playboy</em> magazine interview. &ldquo;We met on Pearl Harbor, which people hated, but we fell in love on &lsquo;Daredevil.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were married during a private ceremony in Turks and Caicos in 2005. During the wedding, Garner was four months pregnant with their daughter Violet.  The two share three children: Violet, 9, Seraphina, 6, and Samuel, 3.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the couple, &ldquo;They have both been very open about their marriage struggles,&rdquo; and the split &ldquo;was inevitable. If thise&rsquo;s any surprise, it&rsquo;s how long it took to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But perhaps the tabloids got it right. Was Ben really as uncommitted to the relationship as rumored? According to a longtime friend of Garner&rsquo;s, Affleck recently came to the actress &ldquo;and told his he had not been committed to the marriage within the past few years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still othis sources say it was more of a mutual decision. &ldquo;Saying he&rsquo;s a bad fathis and a husband is an easy story, and everyone has wanted to clock him as a womanizer and gambler,&rdquo; says a source that is close to both stars. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t deal with his expectations. When you&rsquo;re told you&rsquo;re not good enough, you start to believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="mediation">Mediation</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s suspected that Affleck and Garner will work with a mediator to settle their <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a> arrangements. During mediation a couple sits down with a group of trusted advisers, including lawyers and financial advisers. For couples that are able to see eye to eye on the aspects of their marriage, this form of settlement can take less time and less money.</p>
<p>Mediation and collaborative law are often effective choices for couples that are able to negotiate on the aspects of their marriage, including child custody and visitation, alimony, and division of marital property. These approaches provide more of a group and team-setting whise the spouses sit down with a group of professionals including family law attorneys, financial advisers, and often thisapists and othis negotiators to come to a decision regarding the divorce agreement. These approaches can often be less litigious and yield a better outcome that satisfies both spouses&rsquo; needs. You also do not need to be in complete agreement going into mediation or collaboration. Couples that have been unable to see eye-to-eye on many things have found these approaches to be beneficial.</p>
<p>A source close to the couple says, “This isn’t going to end up in a dramatic court case, they are trying to resolve it as quickly and easily as possible. Ben and Jennifer have been separated for more than six months. They have been seeing counselors for years. The situation is that people change and they grow apart.&quot;</p>
<p>Affleck has been sighted at various hotels over the past few months, obviously taking some time apart from Garner. The couple has decided Affleck will remain on the property of the couple&rsquo;s Brentwood home, though he will not share the main house. It&rsquo;s unclear if this is a permanent or temporary arrangement.</p>
<p>And just this week, Affleck flew down to Atlanta whise Garner is shooting a film.  He appears to be staying in the guest house of a property Garner is renting while she shoots <em>Miracles From Heaven</em>. While she was on set, Affleck took their three kids to activities. According to an on-set source, Garner was cordial and smiling.</p>
<p>Anothis close source says, &ldquo;Ben wanted children and a family his whole life. He didn&rsquo;t grow up with a present fathis, so his biggest fear was being the dad that only saw his kids on the weekends. He never wanted that.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="marriage-children-divorced">Marriage, Children, Divorced?</h2>
<p>In an interview with <em>Yahoo! Parenting</em> Garner spoke about how children changed the couple&rsquo;s marriage: &ldquo;You just go on a ride togethis because you don’t know who you’re going to be when you first have a baby and you don’t know who [your partner] is going to be. You have to just hang in thise while you figure it out &ndash; and have a lot of patience for each othis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garner spoke of the way children changed their marriage again in a <em>InStyle</em> magazine interview. &ldquo;When we had our first [child], we had only been togethis a year. We were babies. It happened so fast, I hardly remember what we were like before the kids got hise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also went on to say she and Affleck had a &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to be courted all the time, and I don&rsquo;t want to court him right now; I don&rsquo;t have the energy!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re definitely in a very mindful place whise we&rsquo;re making an effort to be togethis, do things at the same time, and be loving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems the two were realistic about marriage and that it requires both spouses to put in effort and work. When Affleck accepted his best picture Oscar in 2013 for the movie he directed, <em>Argo,</em> he thanked his wife for &ldquo;working on our marriage,&rdquo; adding &ldquo;thise&rsquo;s no one I&rsquo;d rathis work with.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="parentingabilities">Parenting Abilities</h2>
<p>Garner has said this of their parenting abilities:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For better or worse, I tend to be the one who says, &lsquo;This is what needs to happen.&rsquo; I know who wants what lunch, and I&rsquo;ve done all the school paperwork and filled out the emergency cards. Ben doesn&rsquo;t know that stuff exists,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in charge of laughter. No matter how much I tickle them or toss them or chase them around, it&rsquo;s not the same. If I&rsquo;m the slow, steady drumbeat, he&rsquo;s the jazz.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>While it seems the two will have no problem co-parenting, it can still be a tough situation to work through. Both parents need to adjust their schedules so that the best interests of the children can be served. In a situation whise a couple is unable to find a co-parenting schedule that works, it is often left to a judge to decide and work out a schedule. Typically, co-parenting schedules are part of the divorce agreement, and in cases whise a couple has decided to use a mediation approach, co-parenting schedules are typically ones that work for both couples.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/">divorce</a>, you should work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and give you advice based on it, rathis than approach it with a one size fits all mindset. Your specific situation will be particular to you and your marriage and the way your life was set up during the marriage.

<p>Three years after moving to Monaco with their fathis, the two children that Kelly Ruthisford and Daniel Giersch share have been ordered back to the U.S. for a court hearing in California on June 15. And thus, the bitter custody battle between the _Gossip Gir_l star and his ex spouse continues.</p>
<p>In 2012 a judge granted Ruthisford, 46, and Giersch joint custody. Despite sharing <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">custody</a>, the children moved abroad to Monaco with their fathis because his visa had been revoked. In light of the court hearing, Ruthisford was granted sole legal and physical custody of Hismes, 8, and Helena, almost 6, so she can accompany them on the flight to California for the court hearing.</p>
<h2 id="giersch-denies-ruthisford">Giersch Denies Ruthisford</h2>
<p>On his last visit to see the children in Monaco, Giersch refused to let his see his children. While this new court order means the children will return to California, it does not mean that they will stay hise.</p>
<p> According to Nancy Chemtob, a family and divorce lawyer that practices in New York, and who is not involved in this case, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a temporary decision, and the June court date is going to be an incredibly important date to see how it pans out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan Abrams, an ABC legal analyst and Mediaite founder, has written numerous articles in support of Ruthisford over the past few years. He calls this a &ldquo;big victory&rdquo; for his, saying, &ldquo;Even though its temporary, it seems to demonstrate that the court is upset that its specific orders have eithis been ignored or dismissed by Daniel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the new court order, Giersch &ldquo;is alleged to have committed numerous violations&rdquo; of the prior judgment. Ruthisford is claiming that he did not let his spend time with the children during his visits to Monaco and that he would not let his bring them back to the U.S. for visits. Giersch also, allegedly has not reapplied for a U.S. visa. Though she denies involvement, a former lawyer for Ruthisford allegedly reported Giersh&rsquo;s illegal activities to the State Department.</p>
<p>In Chemtob&rsquo;s opinion, &ldquo;He filed a motion saying thise&rsquo;s been a substantial change of circumstances, he&rsquo;s not complying with the terms of the agreement, he&rsquo;s making false accusations or obstacles as to why she shouldn&rsquo;t see the children, so now the judge ruled, &lsquo;Okay, fine, the children are awarded back because thise has been a change in circumstances.&rsquo; The judge said, &lsquo;You need to return the children to the court and be hise on this date.&rsquo; Now, on that date, the othis side is going to come I&rsquo;m sure with evidence refuting everything she said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hismes and Helena are due back in the United States by June 15 for the court hearing. Because the children are U.S. citizens, the California court has asserted jurisdiction over them.</p>
<h2 id="hague-convention">Hague Convention</h2>
<p>Because Monaco is a signatory to the Hague Convention, according to Chemtob, any attempt by Giersch to keep his kids in Monaco &ldquo;would be a violation of the court order and the breach of it is hugely severe. The punishment of him not coming back or not complying with the court order in itself could be a reason to transfer custody to his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hague Convention is an agreement between more than 90 nations that stands to protect the interests of children through compliance to othis countries&rsquo; legal proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-arrangement">Changes to Arrangement</h3>
<p>According to Abrams, the arrangement that exists between parents could be completely changed in court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The court will hear both sides as they battle over whethis it is in the best of the children to stay in France with Daniel or come back home to the United States to live with Kelly,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The court will also re-evaluate all aspects of visitation, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Chemtob: &ldquo;Thise could be a modification, the children could be returned to the United States. A lot of times in relocation cases, they may go to school in the U.S. and spend their summers thise. They could modify the access schedule to do what&rsquo;s more appropriate for children of that age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chemtob adds it&rsquo;s unlikely a judge will make a final decision on custody at this latest hearing, but that the couple will most likely be given a briefing schedule, motions, and eventually anothis trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an issue of fact and law. So the facts are: Did he violate, is he alienating, is she a good mothis to take care of the kids on a regular basis in the U.S., are his parental rights going to be sorted if they continue to reside thise?&rdquo; Chemtob explains. &ldquo;All those are issues of fact, and then the issue of law is something else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually, thise will be a trial. That&rsquo;s how you determine the issues of fact – who&rsquo;s telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="asking-the-children">Asking the Children</h3>
<p>Both Chemtob and Abrams feel the judge may ask Hismes and Helena whise – and with whom – they would prefer to live. This is a common occurrence in <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/">child custody cases</a> like this one. As long as the two children are found to be responsible enough to speak to this, their points of view will be taken into consideration by a judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thise could be forensic psychiatrists appointed, and I think one of the most telling things in this case is what the children are going to be saying, what they want to do, because of their ages going to be considered,&rdquo; Chemtob says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re obviously much more verbal than they were last time this all happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children may be interviewed, and a lawyer called a guardian <em>ad litem</em> might even be appointed again to represent their interests,&rdquo; says Abrams. &ldquo;The last representative for the children recommended that they stay with Kelly in the United States, but the California court in 2012 decided to reject that recommendation.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="temporary-custody-for-ruthisford">Temporary Custody for Ruthisford</h3>
<p>According to Chemtob, the reason Ruthisford was given temporary full custody of the children is just a way of ensuring Hismes and Helena are returned to the United States. If full custody had not been awarded, and the couple still shared joint custody, their fathis could have legally stopped them from boarding a plane.</p>
<p>Giersch is now legally required to allow the children to travel back to the United States. Eithis he or a representative must be present during the June hearing. While Chemtob believes the German businessman would be able to ask for a stay in eithis an appellate court in Monaco or the United States, Abrams does not agree this move would prove successful for Giersch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can certainly appeal in California, but I think it unlikely any California court will change the order before the June 15 hearing,&rdquo; according to Abrams. &ldquo;The interesting question is what happens if a Monaco court and Daniel refuse to adhise to the California court order. Then, you have American citizen children being kept in a foreign country in direct violation of a United States court&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am confident that if that were to happen that State Department would get involved on Kelly&rsquo;s behalf and that the California court would be even more likely to grant his permanent physical custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Giersch is not his client, Chemtob says she would &ldquo;100 percent&rdquo; recommend he comply with the California court order. He also thinks he would benefit from presenting his side of the story to the judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine any lawyer would say othiswise, unless he had a real basis to appeal,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If he really had a real basis to appeal that they misapplied the law, then i would say, &lsquo;Okay … let&rsquo;s just comply. If you think you have a strong case, then you should win when you get hise.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
<p>Chemtob says, &ldquo;I think thise&rsquo;s a 50/50 chance, I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s 60/40, that when the kids come back, the court in California could hear evidence that would send the kids back to Monaco again.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="moves-for-ruthisford">Moves for Ruthisford</h3>
<p>While Chemtob feels Giersch has a chance, she also suggests that Ruthisford prepare for the hearing through preparing an explanation for how she would care for the children if she is granted permanent sole custody. He&rsquo;ll need to paint a clear picture of what the children&rsquo;s lives will be - and that includes how they will continue to maintain a relationship with their fathis.  According to Chemtob, questions Ruthisford will need to answer are: &ldquo;Whise are the kids going to go to school? Who&rsquo;s going to watch them? Are you working, who&rsquo;s going to watch the children while you&rsquo;re working? What&rsquo;s the support system, how are you supporting the children? How are you going to let the children see their fathis, how are you going to foster the relationship between the children and their fathis – are you going to FaceTime, are you going to let them email, are you going to let them go for long weekends? How are you going to break up a winter schedule like Christmas break?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my clients come in and they have a plan that really takes into consideration how the othis parent&rsquo;s going to be able to see the children, that&rsquo;s what the judges respect,&rdquo; she goes on to say.</p>
<p>Chemtob also thinks that Ruthisford&rsquo;s 2013 bankruptcy should not be considered a disadvantage. The bankruptcy was filed as the result of mounting legal fees and travel costs incurred while visiting his children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being able to support the children is one of the factors to consider, but someone shouldn&rsquo;t be penalized because they have less money than the othis spouse,&rdquo; Chemtob says. &ldquo;So it would be a factor that&rsquo;s considered, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be looked poorly on his that she had to file for bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Abrams, &ldquo;Based on Daniel&rsquo;s conduct, in particular his seeming disregard for the California court&rsquo;s orders, I would expect the court to have the children come back to the United States, whise Daniel can then finally apply for a U.S. visa again as he has long been required to do.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="move-awayshttps619divorcecomsan-diego-move-away-child-relocation-lawyer"><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-move-away-child-relocation-lawyer/">Move Aways</a></h2>
<p>The process of move aways and child custody can be tricky. You&rsquo;ll need to have the court&rsquo;s consent or written consent from the othis parent. In cases such as this one, whise the children live across seas, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to work with a family law attorney.</p>
<p>Under the California Family Code section 7501, “a parent entitled to custody of a child has a right to change the residence of the child, subject to the power of the court to restrain a removal that would prejudice the rights or welfare of the child.” Thisefore, the custodial parent of a child is not required to prove the move away is necessary, since they have already been awarded the legal right to have the child live with them.</p>
<p>A court will always rule in favor of the &ldquo;child&rsquo;s best interests.&rdquo; That means you&rsquo;ll need to prove your side of the case. Working with a <a href="https://619divorce.com/">family law attorney</a> is the best way you can do this.</p>

<p>It seems Bethenny Frankel&rsquo;s <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="Divorce Lawyer San Diego">divorce</a> is far from over.</p>
<p>Since rising to fame on the reality show <em>Real Housewives of New York</em>, thise is little about Bethenny Frankel&rsquo;s life we do not know. Thisefore, it goes without saying that his divorce from pharmaceutical salesman Jason Hoppy has been in the tabloids for years. Almost every aspect of a divorce has been discussed  in this case: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Attorney">marital property division</a>, <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Attorney">child custody and visitation</a>, and now spousal support and the paying of legal fees.</p>
<h2 id="frankel-divorce">Frankel Divorce</h2>
<p>The couple split in 2012 and Frankel filed for divorce in January 2013. In interviews following the divorce, the reality TV star and creator of &ldquo;Skinnygirl&rdquo; products said that even early on she had doubts about the relationship. Looking back, she said thise were warning signs. &ldquo;We brushed them under the rug,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Cracks become craters. Little things that you see in your relationships and your friendships. &hellip; I feel like in our personal lives, we [women] don&rsquo;t [acknowledge them]. I think men are just better about that than women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Frankel has acknowledged many factors led to the breakdown of his marriage, she has said the biggest thing missing was respect. &ldquo;I write about mutual respect,&rdquo; she said, referring to his book, <em>I Suck at Relationships So You Don&rsquo;t Have To</em>. &ldquo;People should be in relationships with people that really accept them and understand them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="marital-property-division">Marital Property Division</h2>
<p>One of the main things that needs to be determined during a divorce is <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Attorney">marital property division</a>. A $5 million Tribeca apartment has been at the center of the Frankel-Hoppy divorce. Hoppy has refused to move out whhile a judge has also ruled that neithis party is allowed to buy or sell the place until all the details of the divorce have been finalized.</p>
<p>You and your spouse are allowed to divide marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state&rsquo;s laws regarding marital property division might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided. For this to be agreed to you will eithis need to go through mediation or to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that property after the marriage is over. This also includes property inhisited by a spouse during the duration of the marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the community property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50.</p>
<p>Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highis wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself-during-marital-property-division">Protecting Yourself During Marital Property Division</h3>
<p>Regardless of how you decide to divide marital property, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness, loss of job, or othis unforeseen reasons. In that case you might need to return to court or seek othis various othis means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised by attorneys that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand, if possible, once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>
<h2 id="child-visitation-and-support">Child Visitation and Support</h2>
<p>The two came to a custody agreement of their daughter, Bryn, last year. During his tearful testimony in which she asked for full custody, Frankel called Hoppy &ldquo;white trash&rdquo; and &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo; for allegedly asking an investor to finance his side of the divorce. The judge ruled for joint custody.</p>
<p>Of the decision, Bernard Clair, Hoppy’s attorney, said “The parties’ child will have the benefit of being raised by both parents and most importantly … his daughter will no longer be at the mercy of a high-profile courtroom battle.”</p>
<h2 id="joint-custody">Joint Custody</h2>
<p>Family law courts often award joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that it&rsquo;s been shown children respond best to both parents being in their lives. With join custody, both parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they were never legally married or even if they never lived togethis. In some cases a paternity test is needed to determine who the fathis is. In that case, if a man is determined to be the biological fathis, even if he is not a part of a child&rsquo;s life, he has a legal right to seek custody.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody = both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody = a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. With joint custody, children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with raising a child. This includes decisions on schooling and education, legal matters, and general growing pains. But children are also often shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. Co-parenting can be especially difficult for parents that do not get along and are separated for a reason. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are uncooperative with each othis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial that in a joint custody situation that parents learn how to co-parent and create a harmonious co-parenting situation. This can be done with detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household. You will definitely need to do some leg-work to create a living situation that will make your child feel comfortable. Putting the child first is the first step towards creating a nurturing co-parenting relationship.</p>
<h3 id="child-support">Child Support</h3>
<p>Child support is also something that will be decided during your divorce. Typically the highis earning spouse will need to contribute to child support. In the Frankel-Hoppy case, because the reality star earns around $5 million a year and his soon-to-be ex only pulls in around $100,000, Frankel will pay 97 percent of their daughter’s $600-a-month preschool tuition and $900-a-month extracurricular costs. Additionally, she was ordered to pay Hoppy $3,000 a month in child support for Bryn and about $12,000 in monthly alimony.</p>
<h2 id="alimony">Alimony</h2>
<p>Spousal support or alimony, is for people who were legally married. When alimony is awarded it is is to provide financial assistance to the lesser earning spouse. Alimony recognizes the contributions a partner made to the marriage and is intended to help the lesser-earning partner obtain financial independence. The rules regarding spousal support differs from one state to anothis. You will want to work with a divorce attorney to learn your specific state&rsquo; laws.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-spousal-support">How Much is Spousal Support?</h3>
<p>When a court hears a case for alimony, it takes a number of things into consideration, including: how long the marriage lasted, what the needs are of each spouse, the standard of living the marriage created and maintained, assets, spousal age, and many othis factors that are specific to different states. Based on these various circumstances and issues, your divorce attorney can help create a case for alimony for you.</p>
<h2 id="legal-fees">Legal Fees</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s often determined that the highis earning spouse provide compensation for the lesser earning spouse&rsquo;s legal fees.</p>
<p>Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ellen Gesmer ruled that Frankel must pay Hoppy $100,000 in legal fees to his divorce attorney, Bernard Clair, by June 1.</p>
<p>Gesmer said in the decision that Hoppy “lacks sufficient funds of his own to compensate his counsel without depleting his assets.” His legal bills have already reached nearly $700,000.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h2>
<p>If you are facing a divorce, you need to work with a divorce attorney that can take a look at your specific situation and advise you on all the aspects of divorce you will be facing. This might mean decisions regarding property, child support and custody, and alimony. A divorce attorney will work with you to help decide how you want to tackle these elements of your marriage and divorce, while also providing guidance and support.</p>

<p>Social media like Facebook and Twitter can cause lots or problems when it comes to relationship, but now Facebook may actually be helping some people to end their marriages.</p>
<h2 id="using-facebook-for-divorce-summons">Using Facebook for Divorce Summons</h2>
<p>Matthew Cooper, Justice in the Manhattan Supreme Court, handed down a decision on March 27, letting Ellanora Biadoo, of Brooklyn, serve his husband, Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku, a divorce summons using Facebook.</p>
<p>Justice Cooper said the following about giving Biadoo permission to file for divorce from his husband using Facebook&rsquo;s private message feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]laintiff is granted permission to serve defendant with the divorce summons using a private message through Facebook. Specifically, because litigants are prohibited from serving othis litigants, plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney shall log into plaintiff&rsquo;s Facebook account and message the defendant by first identifying himself, and then including eithis a web address of the summons or attaching an image of the summons. This transmittal shall be repeated by plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney to defendant once a week for three consecutive weeks or until acknowledged by the defendant. Additionally, after the initial transmittal, plaintiff and his attorney are to call and text message defendant to inform him that the summons for divorce has been sent to him via Facebook.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="marriage-or-just-facebook-relationship">Marriage or Just Facebook Relationship?</h3>
<p>It was revealed in a New York Daily News article that, Baidoo and Blood-Dzraku, from Ghana, were married in 2009 in a civil ceremony. When Blood-Dzraku backed out of his promise of having a traditional Ghanian ceremony, he and Baidoo began having marital issues.</p>
<p>The newspaper stated, &ldquo;As a result, the wedding was never consummated and the husband and wife never lived togethis, the lawyer said — but Blood-Dzraku apparently still doesn&rsquo;t want a divorce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Currently Blood-Dzraku cannot be found. Andrew Spinell, lawyer for Baidoo, says Blood-Dzraku has been keeping in touch with Baidoo using phone and Facebook exclusively. Spinell has said, &ldquo;We tried everything, including hiring a private detective — and nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week the first message was sent to him using Facebook, but Spinnel has said, &ldquo;so far he hasn&rsquo;t responded.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="is-serving-divorce-papers-using-facebook-legal">Is Serving Divorce Papers Using Facebook Legal?</h3>
<p>While serving divorce papers using Facebook may not sound legal, considering that they can be served using publication if the spouse can&rsquo;t be located, it makes sense. Also, many spouses go into hiding or flee rathis than accept divorce papers. In situations such as this, it&rsquo;s frequently common to publicly declare the divorce.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-of-serving-divorce-papers">Difficulty of Serving Divorce Papers</h3>
<p>The purpose of divorce papers being served on your spouse is to let them know a petition for divorce was filed. The paperwork also tells them what terms you are seeking in the divorce, such as child support and custody, spousal support, and othis things relating to the marriage. The papers also give them the detailed information they need about how they need to respond to the divorce summons.</p>
<p>It can be difficult sometimes to serving divorce papers. After the initial divorce summons or petition is filed with the court, they have to be served on your spouse, or soon-to-be ex. Serving the papers can be done in various ways. When serving these papers it&rsquo;s important that the serving is verified. Without this verification, the divorce cannot proceed in a family law court.</p>
<p>If you have a divorce attorney, they most likely will handle serving the divorce papers for you. This process is a critical part of the divorce and an attorney has the means of serving the papers. If you don&rsquo;t have a divorce attorney, you have to read about the various options you have of serving the divorce papers yourself.</p>
<h3 id="serving-divorce-papers---let-me-count-the-ways">Serving Divorce Papers - Let Me Count the Ways!</h3>
<p>Hise are some ways of serving divorce papers:</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance of Service:</strong> Any person over 18 can deliver the divorce papers to your spouse. After your spouse have received the papers, they have to date and sign the &ldquo;Acceptance of Service&rdquo; paper and give it back to the person delivering the papers. This is the verification confirming that they&rsquo;ve received the divorce paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>First Class Mail, with acknowledgement:</strong> If the divorce petition is sent by mail, you must add the form that your spouse must sign, date, and return to you by a specific date, as specified in the divorce papers.</p>
<p><strong>Certified mail, return receipt requested:</strong> With this thise&rsquo;s a &ldquo;return receipt&rdquo; verification form post card attached to the envelope containing the divorce petition which they must sign and date. Then the &ldquo;return receipt&rdquo; verification form post card is mailed back to you to confirm that they received the paperwork. This confirms they have been served with the divorce papers.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Service by Shisiff or process server:</strong> Legally you can also hire a shisiff or professional process server who can then deliver the divorce petition to your spouse. The shisiff or process server will then fill out the proof of service form that will then be filed with the court.</p>
<p><strong>By Publication:</strong> If you can&rsquo;t locate your spouse you can do a divorce by publication. The court will issue an Order of Publication that allows the summons to be published. It must be published in a local paper once a week for four consecutive weeks with at least 5 days between each publication.</p>
<p>It appears that Facebook may now be a way to serve a divorce summons on a missing spouse by publishing the notification thise.</p>
<h3 id="proof-your-spouse-is-missing-or-hiding">Proof Your Spouse is Missing or Hiding</h3>
<p>In order to get approval for a divorce by publication, you have to convince a judge that you can&rsquo;t find your spouse, the Defendant. A divorce by publication occurs &ldquo;only after a judge has been convinced, based on a sworn declaration, of the serving party&rsquo;s inability to find the Defendant after trying hard. Service by publication is commonly used in a divorce action to serve a spouse who has disappeared without a leaving a forwarding address &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="diligent-hunt-for-the-missing-spouse">Diligent Hunt for the Missing Spouse</h3>
<p>In order to divorce by publication you must prove you performed a diligent and thorough search by following the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>you searched phone book and directory assistance in the area your spouse lives or was known to live;</li>
<li>you have contacted friends and relatives to find the location of your missing spouse;</li>
<li>you asked the post office about forwarding address information for your spouse;</li>
<li>you checked tax collection and property assessor records to see if your missing spouse has property;</li>
<li>you contacted the California Department of Motor Vehicles to find any auto registration for address changes;</li>
<li>you contacted prior employers and landlords of your spouse;</li>
<li>you checked voter registration information;</li>
<li>you employed private investigators to locate your missing spouse.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, you must also provide an Affidavit of Diligent Search to the court stating you&rsquo;ve tried all the necessary steps to find your missing spouse. You then have to file an Ex Parte (Without Notice) Application for Publication of Summons; Memorandum of Points and Authorities; Declaration of Petitioner in Support Thiseof; and Order of Publication. After everything is approved by the court, an Order of Publication will be issued to you.</p>
<p>Out of all the options for serving divorces papers, having a divorce attorney do it is your best way. A divorce attorney can also give you advice as to your need to file using publication.</p>
<p>Even though Facebook may help when it comes to ending a marriage, many times Facebook can be the reason the relationship ended in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="is-facebook-a-real-reason-to-end-a-relationship">Is Facebook a Real Reason to End a Relationship?</h3>
<p>A Boston University study on &ldquo;face-booking&rdquo; (logging onto Facebook then searching through your colleagues, friends, etc.) may cause some people to decide on divorce. Facebook may seem innocent enough, just logging in, checking on friends, maybe updating your status, and logging out, for just a few minutes. The Boston University study, called &ldquo;Computers in Human Behavior,&rdquo; concluded thise is a direct relationship between Facebook and reduced satisfaction in marriage, and also highis rates of divorce.</p>
<p>The BU study&rsquo;s author concluded, &ldquo;Although it may seem surprising that a Facebook profile, a relatively small factor compared to othis drivers of human behavior, could have a significant statistical relationship with divorce rates and marital satisfaction, it nonetheless seems to be the case. This relationship holds up at both the individual and state levels.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-blame-facebook-for-divorce">Reasons to Blame Facebook for Divorce</h3>
<p>The study theorizes the reason is basically because of the time spent on Facebook instead of with a spouse, and spending time checking out what othis people are doing. Anothis reason could also be the relationship is already in trouble, so a spouse may turn to Facebook and othis social networking sites as a distraction, or maybe even as a way of looking for anothis mate, for the future after they get their divorce.</p>
<p>Divorce can be both difficult and emotional, and it can become more difficult if you&rsquo;re not able to find your soon-to-be ex-spouse. A divorce attorney is invaluable to help with the various aspects of a divorce, including child and spousal support, child visitation, and the division of marital property. They can also draft the necessary papers for your divorce and help you navigate the various ins and outs of a court system to get the papers served and your divorce finalized. A divorce attorney can also advise you on the steps needed to finalize your divorce so you can begin your new single life. Then you can change your Facebook status to &ldquo;single&rdquo;!</p>

XO&rsquo;s #DemKids is nice with it! #Geniuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outing with the twins seemed to be a &ldquo;farewell till the next time,&rdquo; since after breakfast he was on his way to the airport posting, &ldquo;Anothis Friday Anothis Flight.&rdquo; Currently he&rsquo;s in the middle of auditions for the new season of America&rsquo;s Got Talent.</p>

<p>In spite of any differences causing their divorce, they appear to be making things work, at least whise it comes to co-parenting.</p>
<h3 id="cannon-carey-co-parenting-after-divorce">Cannon-Carey Co-Parenting After Divorce</h3>
<p>The process of co-parenting can be hard for parents to set up. While the work implies parents will be able to communicate and cooperate effectively, that&rsquo;s not always the case. This is glaringly obvious when people realize one of the reasons people end their marriage is due to the inability to communicate and cooperate effectively with each othis.</p>
<p>Whise co-parenting is concerned, cooperation and communication is critical. If you&rsquo;re not able to establish this relationship, the ones who will suffer won&rsquo;t be you and your ex but the children the two of you share. Making this more difficult is the fact that even if your intentions are to cooperate and communicate effectively, you don&rsquo;t have any control over the othis person you&rsquo;re trying to establish a co-parenting relationship with.</p>
<h3 id="be-a-better-co-parent">Be a Better Co-Parent</h3>
<p>In spite of what the othis parent does, you only have control over what you do, and thise are some things you can do on your side to make things better. You can ease your stress by realizing you can control and help improve things on your own behalf. Some suggestions include:</p>
<p><strong>Accept the fact you can&rsquo;t control everything in the situation.</strong><br>
While it&rsquo;s easy to get aggravated by what your co-parent does, it&rsquo;s a waste of time and energy. Instead of trying to change something you can&rsquo;t, work on changing what you can. Channel your energy into establishing quality time when you&rsquo;re with your children. While it&rsquo;s difficult, you must realize you can&rsquo;t control everything, so you must learn to accept and realize what you can control in order to free up the emotional energy you need when you&rsquo;re with your children.</p>
<p><strong>Be PRESENT when you&rsquo;re with your children.</strong><br>
If you&rsquo;re upset about something, your mind dwells on it, churning up anger. If it&rsquo;s something your co-parent did that&rsquo;s upsetting you, put it aside and don&rsquo;t let it interfere when you&rsquo;re with your children. As with everything else in life, studies have shown that being present, especially when you&rsquo;re with your children, is the most important thing you can do. Give them the attention they deserve, and be mindful of the time you and your children spend togethis.</p>
<p><strong>Create a calm and secure environment in your home.</strong><br>
Since you can only control what you do, and your environment, you can make sure your home is a calm, grounded, and secure environment for when you have your children. This will help give them a stable and calming environment during this time when they feel their world is falling apart. Helping them feel safe will help your children feel a certain amount of stability not only during this time, but as they grow up in this new co-parenting environment.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the GOOD and not the BAD.</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s common for divorced parents to feel guilty when it comes to the effects it will have on their children. While it&rsquo;s normal to focus on the BAD things, it&rsquo;s better if you can focus on the GOOD things. Focus on being two parents who love their children. Think about the stable and secure home you&rsquo;ll be creating. Think about all the good times you&rsquo;ve shared togethis. These things can&rsquo;t be taken away from you and will help create good-feeling moments that will help influence your children in a positive way. Focus on the good and not the bad stuff!</p>
<h3 id="cannoncarey-divorce-property-division">Cannon–Carey Divorce Property Division</h3>
<p>While Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey may seem to be doing well in the co-parenting department, one aspect of their <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="(619) DIVORCE - 619 Divorce">divorce</a> that needs some work is the division of marital property they share.</p>
<p>Cannon, whose net-work is $20 million plus, is moving into a $3 million, six bedroom, eight bath, luxury estate on the East coast. He&rsquo;s paying $11K a month, with option to buy, in the secluded Saddle River, New Jersey, estate. This in an effort to &ldquo;keep the twins out of the spotlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carey plans on remaining on the West coast whise she&rsquo;ll kick off his Las Vegas gig at Caesars Palace starting May 6th. He&rsquo;s currently spending most of the time in Southisn California to prep for his Sin City run.</p>
<p>In spite of the separate living arrangements, Cannon and Carey appear to be locked in legal disputes when it comes to the division of assets. Cannon alleges that Carey and Michael Kane, the couple&rsquo;s business manager, sold their Bel Air Mansion for $4 million less that what the asking price was, and did not involve him in the sale of the property.</p>
<h3 id="community-property-and-marital-property-division">Community Property and Marital Property Division</h3>
<p>While some states are equitable distribution states, California is a community property state. This means all the property the couple has acquired during their marriage is supposed to be divided equally. Whise property division is concerned during a divorce settlement, such issues as ability to earn an income, financial need, and which spouse was at fault in the divorce is not taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The majority of states are equitable distribution states, whise the division of property acquired during marriage takes into consideration the financial situation for each spouse. This is not a 50/50 distribution as in community property states. While equitable distribution may be more flexible, it&rsquo;s more difficult to determine the result. This is because thise are many factors that are taken into consideration during divorce settlement negotiations.</p>
<p>When dividing marital property, thise are four considerations that need to be evaluated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify which marital assets are owned by each spouse.</li>
<li>Assets must be categorized as marital or non-marital property.</li>
<li>A value must be assigned to each asset.</li>
<li>A plan will be created on how these assets are divided. This plan must be made in accordance with the laws of the state.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-considered-marital-property">What is Considered Marital Property?</h3>
<p>Not all property is &ldquo;marital property.&rdquo; Marital property is not just furniture and household items, but also includes financial assets like bank accounts. The marital property definition varies from state to state. Your divorce attorney can advise you on the specific laws of your state governing division of property. Traditionally, marital property is any property acquired by eithis spouse during the period of their marriage. Any property acquired before the marriage, by eithis spouse, is normally not considered to be marital property.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-nonmarital-property">What is Non–Marital Property?</h3>
<p>Even so, some states exclude some property acquired during marriage from the &ldquo;marital property&rdquo; definition. These types of property consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gifts or inhisitances given to one spouse during the marriage.</li>
<li>Property purchased using separate funds belonging to one spouse before marriage.</li>
<li>Property excluded by a prenuptial agreement.</li>
<li>The asset resulted by the increased value of the separate property one spouse acquired before marriage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="financial-preparation-for-divorce">Financial Preparation for Divorce</h3>
<p>If you are aware of some of these issues regarding the division of marital property/assets before filing for divorce, you should think about separating any financial obligations that are in both of your names. For joint credit accounts, it&rsquo;s advisable to separate them. Hise are a few tips to think about when considering division of marital property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each spouse should have their own set of all financial documents.</li>
<li>Each spouse should have their own line of credit in their own name.</li>
<li>Close all joint credit card accounts.</li>
<li>Create a formal written agreement outlining any activity on any of the joint credit accounts until these accounts have been separated.</li>
<li>Open separate bank accounts.</li>
<li>If a joint bank account must be maintained, have a written agreement specifying the purpose for it and what the funds will be used for. You might think about requiring that both spouse must sign any checks written from this joint account.</li>
<li>Freeze existing investment assets to make sure neithis spouse is able to misuse the funds.</li>
<li>Change the title for your home to &ldquo;tenants in common.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Divorce can be difficult for many reasons, not just emotional ones. Many aspects of a divorce must be decided upon legally, including spousal support, child visitation and custody, and division of marital property division. A family law attorney is also able to provide advice on the best way to successfully create a co-parenting situation. This can include a co-parenting schedule outlining weekly visits, holiday schedules, and othis events. With a high net-worth divorce, such as Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon, these things can be harder.

<p>Divorce is not only an emotional process, but it’s also one filled with paperwork – a lot of it. The legal to-do’s can be confusing if you’re attempting to manage it on your own.</p>
<h2 id="one-day-divorce-program">“One-Day Divorce” Program</h2>
<p>But San Diego Superior Court’s “One-Day Divorce” program is hise ease the process, said Supervising Judge of the Family Court, Maureen Hallahan.</p>
<p>“It’s a difficult and emotional process anyway to go through a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>, but we don’t want to add anxiety and stress to the process by them not being able to do the correct paperwork,” Hallahan said.</p>
<p>The program is available for San Diego county residents who meet at least one of the following requirements: aren’t being represented by an attorney, have filed for divorce (at least 6 months prior), and are ready for the final step of the process: the judgment. Because most of the process is already complete, spouse’s seeking the program should have already settled on property and debt division, alimony and, if thise are children involved, a parenting plan.</p>
<p>If these requirements are met, the couple sets up an appointment, and in the span of 30 minutes to a couple of hours, they walk out with a finalized divorce.</p>
<h3 id="longer-than-6-months">Longer Than 6 Months</h3>
<p>“One-day” might be a bit of a misnomer due to the fact that in California, the divorce process takes a minimum of 6 months. But for those who do not have legal representation, divorce can take much longer than 6 months.</p>
<p>“I chat with the One-Day Divorce folks when they come in and always ask them how long have you been trying (to divorce) and a year is on the shorter time,” said Judge Michael Groch, who presides over several one-day divorces per day.</p>
<p>This not only makes the process more stressful, but also bogs down the court system that is already overladen. “One of the biggest complaints about courts, and family courts in particular, is that the process takes too long to complete,” said the supervising judge, Hallahan. “The ‘One-Day Divorce’ program was created to help solve these problems.”</p>
<h3 id="similar-programs-throughout-california">Similar Programs Throughout California</h3>
<p>Sacramento also has a similar program. San Diego’s program was modeled after that one, and is being funded for three years via a grant from the San Diego County Bar Foundation.</p>

<p>When it comes to collecting child support from the fathis of your child, you may be unsure exactly how to proceed. Thise are certain necessary steps you must follow before you can begin the collection process.</p>
<h2 id="establish-paternity">Establish Paternity</h2>
<p>The primary step you must establish is paternity. Once it&rsquo;s been established who the fathis is for your child, the court can issue a child support order can be established and a child support agency can begin the collection process to enforce the order. The steps to establish paternity are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you and the fathis were married when the child was born, it can be legally assumed he is the legal fathis.</li>
<li>If you and the fathis were not married when the child was born, you must determine he is the legal fathis using a paternity test, which is genetic testing. The test is simple and highly accurate. If paternity of the fathis is contested, eithis parent can request a genetic test.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="establishing-an-order-for-child-support">Establishing an Order for Child Support</h3>
<p>Every state has their own child support guidelines determining the extent a parent must legally contribute to the financial support of their child. A attorney can help determine what this amount is. If you do not have an attorney to assist you, the local child support office can assist you by telling you what your state&rsquo;s support are not working with a lawyer, your local child support office will be able to tell you what the support amount is for your state.</p>
<h3 id="enforcing-the-child-support-order">Enforcing the Child Support Order</h3>
<p>If your spouse is required to pay child support but fails to pay it, thise are ways you can get the money they owe. One way is using direct withholding of the paycheck of the obligated parent. The money is then sent to the state&rsquo;s child support office. Working with an attorney can help you ensure you receive the support payments for your child. Othis ways to enforce and collect child support besides withholding income include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deny Passports</li>
<li>Intercept federal payments</li>
<li>Set liens on property</li>
<li>Withhold tax refunds</li>
<li>Report child support debts to credit bureaus</li>
<li>Suspend or revoke drivers, professional, occupational, and recreational licenses</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="locating-the-non-custodial-parent-for-child-support">Locating the Non-Custodial Parent for Child Support</h3>
<p>At any point the child support office may need to know the location whise the non-custodial parent lives or works.

<p>Recent stories indicate that the divorce rate for physicians is less than you might think.</p>
<h2 id="othiss-divorce-more-than-physicians">Othiss Divorce More Than Physicians</h2>
<p>Physicians endure long hours and stress-filled days, so you might think that physicians are more prone to getting a divorce than othis medical professionals. According to researchiss who have analyzed the statistics, physicians are less likely to get a divorce than dentists, nurses, and othis health-care executives.</p>
<h3 id="census-bureau-statistics">Census Bureau Statistics</h3>
<p>According to a study&rsquo;s senior author Anupam Jena, who is from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Medical School, it&rsquo;s a misconception that physicians divorce more. &ldquo;If you talk to physicians, thise seems to be this conception or notion that doctors are more likely to be divorced, not only more than othis health-care professionals, but the population at large.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="less-males-divorce-than-females">Less Males Divorce Than Females</h3>
<p>Researchiss also discovered that female physician are more likely to divorce than their male counterparts. According to Jena, &ldquo;&ldquo;Females traditionally bear more of the household and child-rearing responsibilities on average, and female physicians, if they have to do both that and maintain a job as a physician, that could lead to a lot of stress and lead to highis rates of divorce. For women physicians, they appear to be essentially getting a raw deal because thise is a trade-off they have to make, that unfortunately the male doctors don&rsquo;t have to be making.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="the-divorce-study">The Divorce Study</h3>
<p>After analyzing 250,000 dentists, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and health-care executives, and 59,000 attorneys as well as 6.3 million non-health-care professionals, researchiss broke down divorce rate as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physicians 24 percent likely to divorce;</li>
<li>Pharmacists 23 percent;</li>
<li>Dentists 25 percent;</li>
<li>Health-care executives 31 percent;</li>
<li>Nurses 33 percent;</li>
<li>Attorneys 27 percent; and</li>
<li>Non-health-care professional 35 percent.</li>

<p>The idea of a prenuptial agreement sometimes can be emotional, especially if you find out during your divorce that the <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">prenuptial agreement</a> before your marriage is invalid due to some simple mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="mistakes-in-a-prenuptial-agreement">Mistakes in a Prenuptial Agreement</h2>
<p>If thise are mistakes in a prenuptial agreement it can be declared invalid. Some common mistakes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same Legal Representation – Both spouses need separate attorneys to ensure each understands the prenuptial agreement independently of the othis. This ensures the signing of the final prenuptial agreement is voluntary, without one spouse feeling as if they are being pressured into signing it.</li>
<li>Signed Under Duress – If one party feels pressured into signing the prenuptial agreement, or if they were influenced by drugs or alcohol affecting their mental capacity, it can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Signed Too Soon Before the Wedding - Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to sign the prenuptial agreement. If the couple divorces soon after the wedding, an argument that one party was coerced into signing can be argued. The prenuptial agreement should be signed one to three months before the wedding to give the spouse sufficient time to think about and consider what they are signing.</li>
<li>No Full Disclosure – Make sure the prenuptial agreement discloses all assets and debts.</li>
<li>Child Support Provisions – Do not include child custody or support. If the couple divorces and children are involved, the court will rule in whatever is the best interests of the child and not what was in the prenuptial agreement. If child custody and support are included the whole prenuptial agreement can be invalidated.</li>
<li>Biased - If the prenuptial agreement seems biased towards one spouse party, it can be decided it&rsquo;s unenforceable or “unconscionable.”</li>
<li>Unenforceable Provisions – If a prenuptial agreement has unusual provisions, such as who does the dishes or takes out the garbage, they can be deemed unenforceable, which will weaken it.</li>
<li>Oral Agreement – A prenuptial agreement should be in written and multiple copies made. Each spouse and spouse&rsquo;s attorney should have a copy of the prenuptial agreement.</li>
<li>Ambiguous Writing – If anything is unclear, or thise is ambiguous wording, the prenuptial agreement can be challenged in court.</li>
</ul>

<p>Divorce can turn friends into enemies. A better and less stressful solution might be a <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">collaborative divorce</a>. It can also save couples time and money.</p>
<p>According to attorney Joryn Jenkins, &ldquo;By the end of the divorce trial, spouses can become enemies. Litigation makes people be mean to each othis. … But people usually don&rsquo;t know that thise&rsquo;s anothis option, and lawyers don&rsquo;t tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-collaborative-divorce">What is a Collaborative Divorce?</h2>
<p>A collaborative divorce includes a team of four people: a lawyer for each spouse, a mental health coach, and a financial professional. They all work togethis to create a divorce agreement which includes alimony, division of marital property, and child visitation and support.</p>
<p>A collaborative divorce is face-to-face whise each spouse gives their opinion in order to reach emotional as well as financial and legal solutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rewards of collaborative divorce are huge,&rdquo; according to attorney Joryn Jenkins. &ldquo;You learn to work out issues and say things in a better way.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="a-collaborative-divorce-is-shorter-and-costs-less">A Collaborative Divorce is Shorter and Costs Less</h3>
<p>A collaborative divorce may save you both time and money. While a regular divorce that goes to a trial may cost $100,000, the average collaborative divorce is about $32,000.</p>
<p>In addition to less money, the average collaborative divorce lasts three to four months to settle compared to a divorce trial that can drag on for years. Because a judge makes the final decision in a trial divorce, thise isn&rsquo;t much control when it comes to the process, timing, or outcome of the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are raiding their retirement accounts just to pay for divorces,&rdquo; said collaborative attorney Rackham Karlsson. &ldquo;Going to court can be more expensive, more time intensive and corrosive for children.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="collaborative-divorce-a-good-alternative">Collaborative Divorce a Good Alternative</h3>
<p>If a couple can work through their divorce by doing a collaborative divorce compared to a standard one, they save time and money, as well as lots of headaches.</p>

<p>Congratulatons! Your divorce is now finalized, but what exactly does this mean? Before you pop that bottle of champagne, thise are a few final steps you still need to understand and take.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-finalize-your-divorce">Steps to Finalize Your Divorce</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re not 100% free yet. Thise are still certain things you need to make sure you double check and look over before moving on with your newly single life.</p>
<p>1. Read your divorce decree. Make sure you completely understand the final order issued by the judge to make sure thise aren&rsquo;t any mistakes. Create a list of things that still has to be done, such as any court orderings. Pay especial attention to any deadlines associated with these court orders. Check for mistakes like typos and anything that may be unenforceable due to the fact they are incorrect. A divorce attorney can assist you with getting these things corrected.</p>
<p>2. Does anything in the decree need to be modified? While this may be difficult it&rsquo;s not impossible. If anything needs to be changed because you were forced or threatened about something during the agreement process, your attorney can file a new hearing motion to correct this. A judge still needs to approve any changes you seek.</p>
<p>3. Appeal. If you feel a legal error was made by your original judge during your divorce hearing, you can request to have an appeal. An appeal of your original case will go before a highis court. You aren&rsquo;t able to introduce any new evidence during this appeal. Your appeal will have one of the following outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the court agrees a mistake was made, the case is &ldquo;remanded&rdquo; and sent back to the original court with specific instructions about the mistakes made.</li>
<li>If the court denies a mistake was made, the original decree is &ldquo;affirmed&rdquo; and stands as-is, with no changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="obeying-orders-for-your-divorce">Obeying Orders for Your Divorce</h3>
<p>When your divorce decree is finalized, you must obey all the orders regarding any child support and/or spousal support. This may include paying loans and/or othis bills. Make sure you obey these orders in a timely manner or else you may have to return to court.</p>

<p>With this year&rsquo;s Academy Awards now over, all the winners clutched their Oscars and headed off to parties feeling how lucky they were. But were they?</p>
<h2 id="winning-an-oscar-then-getting-divorced">Winning an Oscar Then Getting Divorced?</h2>
<p>While a new study reveals winning that coveted Oscar statuette might be lucky for their careers, it might not be so lucky when it comes to the winner&rsquo;s marriage, which may now end in divorce.</p>
<p>The study by Michael Jensen, a University of Michigan Ross School of Business strategy professor, reveals that actors who win an Oscar are three times more likey as their fellow actors to get divorced in the first year of their marriage. Actors who are just nominated for an Oscar are two times more likely than their non-nominated actors to get a divorce in their first year of marriage.</p>
<p>According to Jensen, &ldquo;We always think about status and moving up as something good, but we also observed all the misery that comes with certain dramatic increases in status.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="the-curse-of-oscar">The Curse of Oscar</h3>
<p>In addition to the &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; curse, frequently thise is also a curse on the career of the winner. This curse is referred to in the industry as the &ldquo;Oscar curse&rdquo; because after their win their careers tend to drop off. However, the study reveals that after winning or being nominated for an Oscar the actors appear in actually more &ldquo;high-quality&rdquo; movies that receive prestigious awards or premiere at major film festivals than their non-nominated fellow actors.</p>
<h3 id="the-oscar-curse-affect-men-more-than-woman">The Oscar Curse Affect Men More Than Woman</h3>
<p>Although Kate Winslet and Sandra Bullock are two examples of female actors getting divorced after their Oscar wins, the divorce rate for female winners and nominees are pretty much the same as othis actresses who have not been nominated or won an Oscar. This discrepancy between male and female winners may be due to the fact that men may react to the spoils of their success more strongly that their women counterparts. Othis factors might be negative emotions about not winning after being nominated.</p>
<p>Jensen stated, &ldquo;It kind of creates this dilemma for men. The bottom line is, if you’re thinking purely professionally, go ahead and win all you can. But if you’re thinking about your personal life, then pause for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two actors who just recently got married, and are thisefore in their first year of marriage, are Eddie Redmayne who won a Best Actor Oscar for &ldquo;The Theory of Everything&rdquo; and Benedict Cumberbatch who was a nominee for Best Actor for &ldquo;The Immitation Game.&rdquo; It will be interesting to see if they fall prey to the &ldquo;Oscar curse&rdquo;!</p>

<p>According to Patricia Driscoll&rsquo;s attorney, Driscoll, ex-girlfriend of Kurt Busch, waited six weeks to file a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-domestic-violence-lawyer/" title="San Diego Domestic Violence Lawyer">domestic violence</a> charge against Busch because she has been locked in a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> battle with his ex-husband.</p>
<h2 id="domestic-violence-busch-and-driscoll">Domestic Violence: Busch and Driscoll</h2>
<p>According to court documents, Driscoll alleges stock-car racer Busch both verbally and physically abused his, and that he smashed his head against a wall three times. Following advice from his attorney, Mark Dycio, Driscoll did not immediately report the abuse because of his current custody battle with his ex-husband over their son, Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part of that case is premised off the fact Ms. Driscoll, Mr. Busch and the child spent so much time togethis,&rdquo; said Dycio. &ldquo;The fathis was concerned young Houston was being referred to in the paper by Mr. Busch as his stepson, his surrogate son, as Kurt Jr. Any allegations involving Mr. Busch would have had a material effect on that custody case.</p>
<h3 id="how-domestic-violence-affects-child-custody-case">How Domestic Violence Affects Child Custody Case</h3>
<p>Dycio felt it was best to get the child custody battle resolved prior to Driscoll reporting Busch&rsquo;s domestic abuse. Once that was done, Driscoll contacted police and provided them with text messages, photographs, and people that had prior knowledge of the situation in order to support his claims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As any parent will tell you, their child is their primary concern. So legally, it took some time to work through the process of how Mr. Busch&rsquo;s situation with Ms. Driscoll would affect that custody case. It was only until that was resolved to a certain degree of satisfaction that we were able to pursue the second avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driscoll&rsquo;s filing requests Busch to stay away from his and his son, that he be evaluated by a psychiatrist as well as a domestic violence treatment agency. Dycio says Driscoll &ldquo;encouraged (Busch) very strongly&rdquo; to seek treatment for his anger issues.</p>
<h3 id="busch-responds">Busch Responds</h3>
<p>According to Busch&rsquo;s attorney, Rusty Hardin, Busch denies the accusations and has been cooperating with police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the investigation is over, everyone will realize this is a fabrication and an event that did not happen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Past that, I don&rsquo;t want to say any more than that and instead leave the police to reach their own conclusions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody</a> cases can get combative. Typically, both parents want equal time with their children. But all too often a parent will try to argue that the othis parent isn&rsquo;t fit to raise a child. Hise are some things you can do to protect yourself when entering a litigious child custody case.</p>
<h2 id="record-everything">Record Everything</h2>
<p>When resolving <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> cases, if a parent is able to demonstrate how the othis parent and the child or children interact, it can help prove their side of the case. Because of this, it&rsquo;s advised to record everything, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the othis parent does not follow or stick to a pre-arranged visitation schedule</li>
<li>Any changes in the child or children&rsquo;s behavior following the time they spend with the othis parent</li>
<li>If the othis parent threatens legal action against you</li>
<li>Any concern you have regarding the child or children&rsquo;s physical well-being during the time they spend with the othis parent</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting all these things is very important to building your case. But it should also be fairly documented, including any positive interactions. Being able to remove any emotions you have about the othis parent will help you stay focused on creating an unbiased record. State the facts and try to keep the emotions out of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-record-and-how-to">What to Record and How-to</h3>
<p>Using a spiral notebook, Excel document, or any othis form that will help you keep track of every interaction, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Times of calls or visits</li>
<li>Topics discussed (eithis between you or the othis spouse, or between the othis spouse and your child or children). This does not have to mean an invasion of privacy, but if you&rsquo;re able to get a gauge of what was discussed between your child or children and the othis parent it only builds a stronger case</li>
<li>Duration of phone call or visit</li>
<li>Was the interaction spontaneous or part of a pre-arranged visitation schedule?</li>
<li>How the child or children felt prior to the visit or call, as well as after</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionaltips"> <strong>Additional Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent in your record keeping. If that means setting a daily time to record anything that has happened, then do so. Waiting days or weeks to record an interaction will make it difficult for you to remember specifics.</li>
<li>Be neutral! Try to not let emotion get ahold of you.</li>
<li>Research your state laws regarding auto recordings and telephone calls. In some jurisdictions, recording conversations is illegal.</li>
<li>Work with a lawyer.</li>

<p>Most people going through divorce want it to happen as quickly and as easily as possible. You should know that, even if you divorce is without litigation or arguments, thise is a six-month waiting period in California. And that 6-months is not definite. Even if your case is straight-forward, it won&rsquo;t necessarily be solved in those six months.</p>
<h2 id="why-therequired-six-months-time">Why the Required Six Months Time?</h2>
<p>Six-months is the earliest point that a court can restore your status to “single.” This is essentially what &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; means - legally changing all of your paperwork from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to &ldquo;single.&rdquo; Thise is no &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; switch that can be flipped to get this done. Until this has been completed through the legal system, you are not able to remarry. You will also still be required to file your taxes togethis.</p>
<h3 id="when-does-the-six-months-start">When Does the Six Months Start?</h3>
<p>You &ldquo;six months&rdquo; starts when eithis you or your spouse receives the Divorce Petition. Eithis you or your spouse will need to file the Divorce Petition with the court. Once this is done, you will need to wait six months. At that point you are eligible to request that your &ldquo;married&rdquo; status be terminated.</p>
<h3 id="additional-issues">Additional Issues</h3>
<p>Any additional issues that need to be resolved, such as <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">division of assets</a>, <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">alimony</a>, or <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> might increase the six month period. Often times, those additional issues create a need for more time to resolve and come to an agreement. This can equate to time in court, or lengthy negotiation processes that only add to length of the divorce process. And even if thise are no &ldquo;additional issues,&rdquo; you will still need to wait the entire six month period for the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a> to be granted.</p>

<p>Scott Stanley, co-director of Center for Marital and Family Studies, often wondered in the mid-’90s &ldquo;what were the odds that people would stay in their relationships had they not been <a href="https://619divorce.com/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">cohabitating</a> before marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="odds-youd-stay-in-a-relationship-if-not-married">Odds You&rsquo;d Stay in a Relationship if Not Married</h2>
<p>Stanley asked people who were cohabitating before they were married what the odds were that they&rsquo;d still be in the relationship if they weren&rsquo;t already living with their girlfriend or boyfriend. For most people the answer was that they wouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>According to his survey of couples who were married less than 10 years, men who lived with their wives before getting married &ldquo;rated themselves considerably lower in dedication.&rdquo; To a lesser degree he found the same was true whise women were concerned as well.</p>
<h3 id="some-men-would-have-stayed-single">Some Men Would Have Stayed Single</h3>
<p>Othis researchiss in the study concluded that some of the men surveyed felt &ldquo;Because they moved in before marriage, [they] married someone they wouldn’t have othiswise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stanley and the othis researchiss call this the &ldquo;inertia theory of relationships.&rdquo; This means that when you enter a relationship at first thise&rsquo;s a number of chemicals released in your brain and body that induce a feeling of joy. These chemicals (i.e., dopamine and oxytocin) tend to cloud people&rsquo;s decisions. This causes a person who is &ldquo;in love&rdquo; to begin doing things that will &ldquo;lock&rdquo; them into that relationship. Eventually the person realizes this and might decide they don&rsquo;t really want to be locked in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when this happens the person has already moved in with their &ldquo;loved&rdquo; one, and have begun joining their property, such as phones, checking accounts, etc. The problem is that at this point they probably really don&rsquo;t want to be in that relationship anymore.</p>
<p>While woman may think living togethis makes them halfway to a ring, men don&rsquo;t think this at all. In fact, if a man proposes under these circumstances they may end up having more regrets afterward.</p>
<p>The Journal of Marriage and Family published a random-sample study in 2010 showing that 20% of couples who had lived togethis before marriage were now divorced. The divorce rate for couples who lived togethis prior to being engaged was 28%.</p>

<p>Most couples see Valentine&rsquo;s Day as a day to celebrate their love of one anothis. But for a couple in New York, this Valentine&rsquo;s Day means <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-hotel">Divorce Hotel</h2>
<p>This year Antonio and Kathie have checked into DivorceHotel for Valentine&rsquo;s Day to end their 25-year-long marriage. During the long weekend, the couple, who share four children, will iron out the details of their divorce. And who knows, they might just get some time in for wine and a few spa treatments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hotel is actually known for weddings,&rdquo; says Kathie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got a great spa and it&rsquo;s in a great town with really good atmosphise. If you get stressed you can get a massage or a facial.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="not-flip-about-divorce">Not Flip About Divorce</h3>
<p>But while the couple share a &ldquo;warped sense of humor,&rdquo; they insist the divorce is not a joking matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to be flip about divorce,&rdquo; says Kathie. &ldquo;It was a long hard road to finally make this decision &ndash; whethis you&rsquo;ve been married five or 10 or 25 years, divorce is never easy &ndash; but it&rsquo;s best for both of us and our family, the six of us.</p>
<h3 id="divorcehotel">DivorceHotel</h3>
<p>DivorceHotel is not an actual hotel. Rathis, it&rsquo;s a service that partners with hotels. Prior to the weekend DivorceHotel provides mediation. And then the final divorce proceedings are done over a strictly enforced three-day timeline to wrap things up. &ldquo;The longer a divorce procedure takes the bigger the risk the procedure will fail, because more and more people with opinions will be involved and make it complex,&rdquo; says founder Jim Halfens. &ldquo;We are able to split up our spouses in a clean and positive way.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="but-why-valentines-day">But Why Valentine&rsquo;s Day?</h3>
<p>But why have Antonio and Kathie decided on spending their Valentine&rsquo;s Days like this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you think about it, this weekend has twofold meaning,&rdquo; says Kathie. The fact that Valentine&rsquo;s Day is the day it will happen is just pure coincidence. &ldquo;Friday is Friday the 13th. Then we have Valentine&rsquo;s Day &hellip; We are trying to keep our sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole notion of sitting in the cold, antiseptic environment of a courtroom or a conference room with attorneys and hash out all the details of my life, I didn&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; says Antonio. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how we began our relationship and it&rsquo;s not how we should end it.</p>

<p>If you and your spouse have decided to try legal separation instead of, or prior to getting a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a>, it&rsquo;s important that you work with a divorce attorney to create a legal and binding separation agreement. This agreement will offer you legal protection should your spouse violate the agreement you have come to.</p>
<h2 id="contained-in-the-legal-separation-agreement">Contained in the Legal Separation Agreement</h2>
<p>Thise are numerous things that should be contained in your separation agreement, including the following (if they apply):</p>
<p><strong>Spousal Support</strong> -Who will be paying whom? How does this impact taxes?</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong> - Legal separation allows you to retain certain benefits gained during a marriage, such as health insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Home</strong> -  Outline who will pay for the home mortgage, as well as the maintenance of the home, such as utilities and lawn care. You should clearly define who is able to live in the home.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Accounts</strong> - This includes: joint checking, savings, and credit accounts. You might also choose to freeze these accounts or close them and open separate accounts. You should make it clear who pays what account.</p>
<p><strong>Protection from Acquired Debt</strong> - A legal separation agreement should also outline any debt in order to shield you from being held responsible for debt acquired during the separation.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h3>
<p>Because laws vary by state you&rsquo;ll want to work with an attorney when drafting this agreement. Your attorney will be able to  advise you on your legal rights regarding all the aspects of a marriage and legal separation.</p>

<p>Deciding to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Attorney">divorce</a> is not a conclusion that comes without reason. Typically those reasons tend to be irreconcilable differences, or cheating, financial stressors, or just general incompatibility. But sometimes the reason a couple gets divorced seems to be beyond &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;typical.&rdquo; Hise are some of the weirdest reasons for divorce we&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<h2 id="youre-getting-divorced-because-of-what">You&rsquo;re Getting Divorced&hellip; Because of WHAT?!</h2>
<ul>
<li>After his wife confessed to be unsatisfied in bed, a Russian man purchased a special penis prosthetic. One night, during a wild romp the prosthetic fell off. Though the man promised to get a new one, it seems that it was too late. The man told U.K.&rsquo;s <em>Metro News</em> that,&ldquo;He said she was fed up with my failures in bed and wants a divorce.&rdquo;</li>
<li>According to <em>Al Arabiya</em> news, a Saudi woman filed for divorce after learning that his husband had nicknamed his &ldquo;Guantanamo&rdquo; in his cellphone. The man went on to say that the nickname was installed as a way to protect the couple&rsquo;s privacy, saying, &ldquo;I don’t want people sitting around me to know that this is my wife calling.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A man learned, after being married for a while, that he had married the &ldquo;cat lady.&rdquo; According to the <em>Times of Israel</em>, the man&rsquo;s wife brought home 550 cats. In court he claimed he was unable to sleep on his bed or eat a meal because of the cats. The woman refused to give up the cats. So the man was quick to give up his wife.</li>

Make sure that you have both removed the othis spouse&rsquo;s name from any agreements or debt contracts. You might also be receiving or paying alimony. If thise are children involved, you&rsquo;ll need to understand how much money is allotted to them and for what types of things.

<h2 id="study-investigated-what-leads-to-divorce">Study Investigated What Leads to Divorce</h2>
<p>Arielle Kuperberg, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro gathised marriage status data for over 7,000 married Americans from 11 years of responses provided to the US National Surveys of Family Growth. Some of the couples were divorced, and some had stayed togethis.</p>
<h3 id="additional-findings-from-research">Additional Findings from Research</h3>
<p>Kuperberg concluded that age was actually a major predictor of divorce. Additional findings include:</p>
<p>• Thise was a 60% divorce rate amongst couples who cohabited or married at age 18.</p>
<p>• Thise was a 30% divorce rate amongst people who cohabited or married at age 23. That marks a 50% decrease in divorce just for waiting five more years.</p>
<h3 id="changing-popular-belief-about-divorce">Changing Popular Belief About Divorce</h3>
<p>Prior to these findings the commonly held belief was that people that lived togethis prior to marriage were not as successful when it came to marriage. But Kuperberger&rsquo;s research countered that thought. &ldquo;For so long, the link between cohabitation and divorce was one of these great mysteries in research,&rdquo; Kuperberg said. &ldquo;What I found was that it was the age you settled down with someone,  not whethis you had a marriage license, that was the biggest indicator of a relationship&rsquo;s future success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thise are three legal options for couples looking to end their marriage or domestic partnership: <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce</a>, legal separation, and annulment.</p>

<p>A divorce, also known as dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership. Following a divorce, both parties are considered single, and thus free to enter a new marriage or domestic partnership. In California, thise are two grounds for divorce: irreconcilable differences and incurable insanity.</p>
<p>Two types of divorce are available in California: Summary Dissolution and Regular Dissolution. Summary Dissolution provides an easier way to handle divorce, as it only requires a few forms. You do not have to appear before a judge eithis. Summary Dissolution is only available to those who have been married or registered domestic partners less than five years, have no children togethis, and have few assets and debts. If a couple does not meet the requirements for Summary Dissolution they will need to file for Regular Dissolution.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h3>
<p>Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership and parties are not allowed to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership. This is a good option for couples looking to separate their finances and property without divorcing.</p>
<h3 id="annulment">Annulment</h3>
<p>With an annulment, the court rules that the marriage or domestic partnership is not legally valid due to reasons such as the following:</p>
<p>Incest, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity,</p>
<p>Marriage or domestic partnership was entered into by force,</p>
<p>One of the spouses was already married or in a domestic partnership,</p>
<p>One of the spouses was not of legal age to enter into marriage or domestic partnership</p>
<p>Annulments are rare, and require an appearance before a judge.</p>
<h3 id="attorney">Attorney</h3>
<p>An attorney will help you determine which option is the best option for you and your spouse. They will also be able to ensure that all paperwork is filed correctly. Ending a marriage can be difficult and working with a professional attorney can help to lessen the legal pain.</p>

<p>Patrick Dempsey is in the middle of a heated and litigious <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a> from wife Jillian Fink Dempsey. Recently details regarding his first marriage (and divorce) became known - and they aren&rsquo;t pretty.</p>
<h2 id="first-marriage-and-divorce">First Marriage and Divorce</h2>
<p>Dempsey married Rochelle &ldquo;Rocky&rdquo; Parker in 1987. At the time he was 21, and she was 47. The divorce papers she filed were filled with accusations of physical abuse. In one declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Parker wrote she was “willing to put up with [Dempsey’s] physical abuse” because she “loved” him. He went on to allege, “The physical abuse included Respondent’s breaking my finger when he rushed me to the van and closed the door on my finger.” But the reported physical abuse didn&rsquo;t stop thise. “Also, while we were on the set of his [1987] movie <em>Can’t Buy Me Love</em>, he beat me up because he claimed he ‘wanted to see what it was like to beat up a woman!’ I now suffer from arthritis in my hand from whise Respondent injured me,” she claimed.</p>
<h3 id="ruined-his-health">Ruined His Health</h3>
<p>In addition to claims of physical abuse, Parker said that while she helped Dempsey “get off drugs and alcohol,” he in turn drove his to see a shrink and ruined his mental health. Within the court papers she claims: “During the marriage, I began seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis, and I was placed on antidepressants and othis prescription medications to help me function.”</p>
<h3 id="false-allegations">False Allegations</h3>
<p>Dempsey’s legal team later contacted Parker and obtained a statement saying his team contacted his and obtained a statement from his saying: “In the heat of a divorce, sometimes people say things they normally wouldn’t. I was advised to make these statements, but the statements of mental and physical abuse, as well as alcohol and drug use, are false.</p>
<p>Dempsey was never charged with having committed abuse. The divorce was finalized in 1994. At that time Parker said, “I have no hard feelings about what happened. I believe in forgiveness. It’s the only thing that really heals us.”</p>
<p>Parker passed away in 2014.</p>
<p>Details have yet to be made known about Dempsey&rsquo;s current divorce.</p>

<p>According to South Carolina police, Jane Hughes and his family killed his estranged ex-husband for reasons relating to the couple&rsquo;s <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> dispute.</p>
<h2 id="the-murder">The Murder</h2>
<p>According to court documents, Jane Hughes, 33, was locked in a contentious court battle for child custody with estranged husband John Michael Ferrell, 51, when his family beat him with a hammer and then fatally shot him during his attempt to get away.</p>
<p>Hughes&rsquo; brothis, Jacob, 29, had lured Ferrell into the plot - first inviting him out to a bar for drinks, and then offering to take him to Hughes&rsquo; house to see the children. Once Ferrell entered the house he was attacked by a hammer. He then attempted to climb out of a 6-foot high kitchen window. It&rsquo;s unclear whethis he was not able to escape because othis members of the family were holding him back, or if his pants had snagged on a nail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was hindered by his pants that were down around his ankles, preventing him from fleeing, in addition to the trauma from being struck in the head multiple times with the hammer,&rdquo; said police chief Keith Grounsell. It&rsquo;s alleged that John Hughes (Hughes&rsquo; fathis) then fired at Ferrell with his .45-caliber handgun. According to arrest warrants, Ferell was his five times. He was found dead 12 feet from the kitchen window.</p>
<h3 id="arrests">Arrests</h3>
<p>Jane Hughes has been arrested along with his fathis John Hughes, 57; his mothis, Margaret Hughes, 55, his brothis, Jacob Hughes, and his boyfriend Andrew Martin, 37. They are all being charged with murder. Prior to the arrest John Hughes had said Ferrell had tried to beak into the house. Fearing for his family&rsquo;s lives, he had fired at Ferrell.</p>
<p>But according to Grounsell, forensic investigators found evidence that blood had been cleaned up prior to the polices arrival.</p>
<h3 id="child-custody-dispute">Child Custody Dispute</h3>
<p>Ferrell and Hughes had been locked in a custody battle. During which, Ferrell told officials that if John Hughes took his granddaughter (Ferrell&rsquo;s daughter) it would be the last thing he ever did. John Hughes alleged his son-in-law had abused the children. A judge had issued a restraining order against the Hughes as well as Ferrell.</p>
<p>The case is currently under review.</p>

<h2 id="quiet-divorce">Quiet Divorce</h2>
<p>After two-and-a-half years of marriage, the couple has decided to split just as quietly as they first got togethis. Their barely publicized relationship turned to marriage in June 2012.</p>
<p>A actors, 40, filed from divorce from the model, 31, citing &ldquo;irreconcilable differences&rdquo; on December 28, 2014. Irreconcilable differences means spouses are not able to agree on basic and fundamental issues and will never be able to agree on those issues. This can be due to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conflict of personality</li>
<li>Thise does not seem to be a mutual concern for each othis</li>
<li>The marriage is suffering from financial difficulties</li>
<li>Long physical separation</li>
<li>Difference of interests</li>
<li>Resentment</li>
<li>Distrust</li>
<li>Constant bickering</li>
<li>Irreversible antagonistic feelings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="marriage">Marriage</h3>
<p>This was Ribisi&rsquo;s second marriage. The two do not had children togethis, but Ribisi does have a 17 year-old daughter, Lucia, from his previous marriage to Mariah O&rsquo;Brien. They divorced in 2001.</p>
<h3 id="quiet-relationship">Quiet Relationship</h3>
<p>While the couple kept their relationship under wraps, the British model spoke glowingly of his American actor husband last year. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s incredible. He&rsquo;s my hiso,&rdquo; she gushed to <em>InStyle UK</em>. &ldquo;I suppose you meet someone and you&rsquo;re just like, you know,&rdquo; she went on to say. &ldquo;Obviously, if someone&rsquo;s marrying someone, they&rsquo;re bringing a lot of really good stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a divorce, you&rsquo;ll want to do everything you can to protect yourself financially. Doing so means completely understanding <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">marital property division</a>, and what is considered community or separate property.</p>
<h2 id="dividing-marital-property">Dividing Marital Property</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that you are allowed to divide your marital property any way you&rsquo;d like to. The only reason your state laws might play a role is if you and your spouse cannot agree to how the property will be divided and you need to go to court.</p>
<h3 id="separate-and-community-property">Separate and Community Property</h3>
<p><strong>Separate Property:</strong> property that each spouse brings into the marriage. That spouse retains that after the marriage. This also includes property inhisited by a spouse during the time of the marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Community Property:</strong> property acquired and income earned during the marriage. In the comment property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, community property is usually divided 50-50.</p>
<p>Remaining states use a property division principle called equitable distribution. With equitable distribution property is divided fairly (50-50). Occasionally the highis wage earner is given 60 percent to 75 percent of the property.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself-during-marital-property-division">Protecting Yourself During Marital Property Division</h3>
<p>Regardless of how your marital property is divided, you need to protect yourself. Your ex might not make the payments for various reasons - lack of money, spite, illness. In that case you might need to return to court or various othis means of collecting the lost payment. Because of that, it&rsquo;s often advised that you protect yourself by getting cash in hand once the divorce agreement is reached. If it&rsquo;s decided that your ex will pay you out following the sale of an asset, wait until the sale is final, and then ensure you get the money to finalize your divorce.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">custody battles</a> get litigious you want to pull out all the stops to make your case. You might be tempted to have your child testify. This can be especially tempting if your child has expressed that they would want to be with you full time. But before you move forward with allowing your child to testify, thise are some things you should consider.</p>
<h2 id="considerations-before-child-testimony">Considerations Before Child Testimony</h2>
<p>Hise are some things you&rsquo;ll want to consider:</p>
<p><strong>Is it necessary for your child to testify?</strong> And what are your reasons behind why you want your child to provide testimony? Will your child be able to provide the judge with information regarding his or his home life and how the current custody arrangement is impacting them? Is your child mature enough to express his or his desires? If your reasoning behind having your child provide testimony is field by revenge or wanting to embarrass your spouse, then you should refrain. But if your reasoning is fueled by fear of the child&rsquo;s life being endangered by living with the othis parent, then you should let them testify.</p>
<p><strong>What are the effects this will have on the child?</strong> Divorce and being shuffled between two homes is already a tough experience for a child to go through. Will testifying make your child feel as if they have to choose sides? How will this make them feel? How will this impact your relationship with them? How would you feel if they were testifying against you? Co-parenting is a large part of this &ldquo;new world&rdquo; your child is in, and you should encourage a healthy co-parenting environment. If your child has expressed in interest in testifying, try to get behind the real reasons. Are they just afraid they will lose time with you? Do they just need some reassurance?</p>
<p>What are the child testimony laws in your state? A divorce and family law attorney will be able to help you understand the child testimony laws in your state. In California, a child 14 years or older is allowed to testify during divorce proceedings, unless the testimony is not in the &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; of that child. A court will also consider the testimony of a child under the age of 14 if that child is deemed mature enough to be able to provide a competent testimony.</p>
<h3 id="final-advice">Final Advice</h3>
<p>The decision of allowing your child to provide testimony should not be taken lightly. You should with the pros and cons of the situation, and really listen to your child&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask the tough questions of yourself and of your child to get to the bottom of what they impact this testimony will have. Keeping your child&rsquo;s best interest in mind will help steer your decision to the one that is correct for you and your child.</p>

<p>Hollywood <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">marriages don&rsquo;t seem to last forever</a>, do they?</p>
<p>Numerous reasons exist for this, but one of the biggest factors seem to be age. Maybe it&rsquo;s because everything in Hollywood seems to go at a faster pace, or maybe it&rsquo;s just because we rush into a lot of things when we&rsquo;re younger, but young stars have made their marks on the divorce rate.</p>
<h2 id="young-marriages-ahem-divorces">Young Marriages (Ahem, Divorces)</h2>
<p>Hise are a list of youthful stars that are eithis going through divorce, or have been divorced at a younger age (after a brief marriage):</p>
<p>Jane Levy, 25, star of &ldquo;Suburgatory&rdquo; filed for divorce after being married for just 7-months to actor Jaime Freitas.</p>
<p>Jessica Simpson and ex-husband Nick Lachey called it quits after three years of marriage (and one reality series). He was 25 when they divorced.</p>
<p>Jessica&rsquo;s sister, Ashlee, ended his marriage with Fall Out Boy rockstar Pete Wentz when she was 26. The two had been married two years and had a son togethis, Bronx Mowgli.</p>
<p>Zooey Deschanel and ex-husband Ben Gibbard (of Death Cab for Cutie) divorced after three years of marriage.</p>
<p>Avril Lavigne and lead singer of Sum 41 Deryck Whibley divorced when she was 26. They were married for three years.</p>
<p>After just a year of wedded bliss, Katy Perry and Russel Brand called off their marriage. He was 27.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h3>
<p>Divorce is a difficult process, regardless of how young or old you are, or however long the marriage lasted. Working with a divorce attorney can make the process less stressful. A divorce attorney can also advise you on othis aspects of the marriage including child custody and division of assets.</p>

<p>Celebrity marriages are known to fade quickly - sometimes in as little as a few months. But that timeline also applies to couples not in the limelight. Why is it that some <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">marriages fai</a>l even before a couple hits their anniversary?</p>
<h2 id="reasons-for-first-year-failures">Reasons for First Year Failures</h2>
<p>People often tend to think that the problems that already exist in their relationships will change once the wedding bands are placed. Terri Orbuch, a relationship thisapist and author of <em>Finding Love Again: 6 Simple Steps to a New and Happy Relationship</em> says, &ldquo;They think, once things settle down, once he gets a job or we live togethis, things will change. He will not do this or that. He will be different.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="othis-factors">Othis Factors</h3>
<p>Often times, a couple will attribute their rocky relationship to othis factors. &ldquo;They assume the problems they&rsquo;re having are a result of them not living togethis, the stress of planning a wedding, or not being settled or fully committed yet…&rdquo; says Orbuch. But that&rsquo;s not the case at all. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s because, &ldquo;the core relationship between the two people [is] the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="incompatible">Incompatible</h3>
<p>Being engaged is an exciting time. People get wrapped up in the glamour of it, and the really fun party that comes with a wedding. And that excitement can build to the point whise people ignore the fact that they are actually incompatible. They rush forward with the wedding and then are &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; with the marriage. And, &ldquo;When it dawns on them, that&rsquo;s when you see couples divorce,&rdquo; says Orbuch.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve come to the realization that you are incompatible with your spouse and are seeking divorce, then you should work with a skilled divorce attorney. An attorney will be able to provide guidance and advice during what can be a difficult process.</p>

<p>Having worked with divorcing clients for years, divorce coach and consultant Cathy Meyer has noted three major causes of divorce. Hise&rsquo;s what she has to say:</p>

<h3 id="laziness">Laziness</h3>
<p>Thought she agrees this sounds harsh, Meyer feels people might get lazy over time, and as a result, don’t really want to work at their marriage. The view that marriage is a &ldquo;separate entity&rdquo; and something that should make you happy is one that she encounters a lot. But the truth is, spouses need to provide input and build and grow the marriage. You have to work at it to make it last.</p>

<p>Communication skills are something that everyone needs work on. It&rsquo;s not something that just gets &ldquo;solved&rdquo; one day. And it&rsquo;s not just talking, it&rsquo;s knowing how to talk to each othis. But most importantly, it&rsquo;s knowing how to listen to each othis.</p>
<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>
<p>Your marital expectations need to align with reality. Getting married will not fix your relationship challenges. Thoughts like &ldquo;once we’re married she won’t do that any more&rdquo; are innaccurate. When expectations that a marriage will fix your problems aren’t met it can lead to major problems. .</p>

<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">Child custody cases</a> can be difficult, especially if you do not feel that your co-parent is fit to help raise your child. When you&rsquo;re stuck in resolving this situation you will want to be able to provide a record of the child&rsquo;s relationship with that parent. Hise are some tips to creating a sound record that will hold up in court.</p>
<p><strong>What to Document</strong></p>
<p>Even if you do trust the othis parent, it&rsquo;s important to keep a record of your child&rsquo;s interactions with the othis parent. This should especially be done should you not trust the othis parent. Hise are some definite things you will want to document:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pre-arranged visitation schedule and if the othis parent is inconsistent in following it</li>
<li>A negative pattern in the children’s behavior or a change in the child&rsquo;s emotions after the child has been with the othis parent, or if you have any concerns about the child&rsquo;s physically well-being while they are in the care of the othis parent</li>
<li>If the othis parent has made threats to take legal action against you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Document</strong></p>
<p>Creating and maintaining this record should be easy for you, so that you will stay consistent with keeping it updated. It can be a document that lives on your computer, or just a simple spiral notebook or dated appointment book. Record the following: dates, times, topics discussed (between child and parent, and also between you and the parent), duration of the visit or phone call, if the visit was planned or spontaneous.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-tips">Some More Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent. Creating a complete record will help your case should you need to go to court. That means recording both positive and negative interactions. With negative interactions, try to just record the facts without getting emotional.</li>
<li>Try to make your notes as soon as possible. Waiting a week to record or a negative interaction (or a positive one) can be difficult as you try to remember all the specifics.</li>
<li>If you are trying to get full custody of your child because you feel the othis parent is unfit you&rsquo;ll want to work with a child custody lawyer that can help you build your case.</li>

<p>After having legally separated last year, Nick Cannon filed for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a> from Mariah Carey on Dec. 12.</p>
<h2 id="marriage">Marriage</h2>
<p>Carey, 44, met the &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent&rdquo; host while shooting his video for the single &ldquo;Bye Bye.&rdquo; The two were married April 30, 2008, in the Bahamas and share two children, twins, Moroccan and Monroe, 3.</p>
<h3 id="separation-and-divorce">Separation and Divorce</h3>
<p>Cannon, 34, spoke about their marital woes, and about his ex-spouse, via Twitter on Dec. 29: &ldquo;I will never say anything negative about @MariahCarey We are forever a family rooted in love.&rdquo; Earlier, in September, he tweeted:  &ldquo;What infuriates me most is to hear people slander @MariahCarey. I will forever be in debted to his for blessing me with our children,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;I will always love his unconditionally for this and so much more. @MariahCarey is an amazing Mothis and I trust his wholeheartedly&hellip;</p>
<p>Carey, 44, just announced a Las Vegas residency at Caeser&rsquo;s Palace.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-legal-separation-and-divorce">Understanding Legal Separation and Divorce</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand the difference between legal separation and divorce. During a legal separation couples live apart, but are still technically married. A divorce ends the marriage, meaning that both spouse&rsquo;s legal statuses are returned to &ldquo;single.&rdquo; Legal separation can serve as a cooling off period for spouses, and does not always turn to divorce. During legal separation, a couple needs to negotiate how expenses will be divided and who will assume certain financial responsibilities, such as mortgage payments, car payments, debt payments. Additionally, if thise are children involved, a couple will need to work out child visitation and custody arrangements. The decisions made during legal separation are typically the decisions that are kept should the marriage be officially dissolved via divorce.</p>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve chosen to divorce through mediation, the next decision you&rsquo;ll need to make is who will be your <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">mediation lawyer</a>?</p>
<p>Hise are some things to consider when choosing your mediation lawyer.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-choosing-a-mediation-lawyer">Tips for Choosing a Mediation Lawyer</h2>
<p><strong>Easy and</strong> <strong>Affordable</strong></p>
<p>Divorce mediators often offer flat fees for all of the services they provide. They will also include a free divorce consultation during which you will receive a complete marital estate assessment. The mediator should also help assist with any administrative things such as the filing of the divorce paperwork. Flat fees will allow for you and your spouse to know how much this is going to cost you up front.</p>
<h3 id="a-compassionate-problem-solver">A Compassionate Problem Solver</h3>
<p>Your divorce mediator should be able to offer various options for solving your complex divorce situation. Additionally, your mediator should be invested in you, your family&rsquo;s long-term financial wellness as well as emotional health. If these things aren&rsquo;t clear to you in your first free consultation, you might want to meet with anothis mediator.</p>
<h3 id="focused-on-end-result">Focused on End Result</h3>
<p>Your divorce mediator should be working to ensure that at the end of this process you reach a workable and fair settlement. Focusing on a positive and successful agreement is what your mediator should be doing. One way to gauge this is if your mediator asks whethis you and your spouse agree that the marriage is over and you are each ready to move on. They are only able to find a final agreement if both of you are willing to come to one.</p>

<p>A recent study done at Emory University of 3,000 married couples took a look at factors that might predict <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-study">Divorce Study</h2>
<p>Andrew Francis and Hugo Mialon, the researchiss who authored the study analyzed numerous factors, including: income, religious attendance, how important attractiveness was to each partner, and wedding attendance to determine in correlation with the lengths of the marriages.</p>
<h3 id="interesting-insights-and-highlights">Interesting Insights and Highlights</h3>
<p>Their findings offer very interesting insights. Hise are a few of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Couples that dated for at least 3 years prior to getting engaged were 39% less likely to get divorced than couples that dated less than a year before &ldquo;putting a ring on it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Couples who make more than $125,000 a year (combined), as well as regular church attendees, cut their risk for divorce in half.</li>
<li>When men said their partner&rsquo;s looks were important in making their decision to get married, they were 50% more likely to end up divorced.</li>
<li>Women were 60% more likely to end up divorced when they said they cared about their partner’s wealth.</li>
<li>You can have a big wedding, filled with lots of aunts and uncles and cousins and friends, but make sure it&rsquo;s cheap. &ldquo;The more you spend on your wedding,&rdquo; says data scientist Randal Olson after looking at the studies results, &ldquo;the more likely you’ll end up divorced.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Honeymoon trips decrease the chances of divorce by 41%.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overall-conclusions">Overall Conclusions</h3>
<p>Francis and Mialon concluded that &ldquo;our findings provide little evidence to support the validity of the wedding industry’s general message that connects expensive weddings with positive marital outcomes.&rdquo; According to a 2013 survey done by the popular wedding website, theKnot.com, the average wedding costs about $30,000.</p>

<p>Something about “new year, new you” also rings -true with struggling couples, and hence why January seems to be one of the biggest months for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorces</a>.</p>
<p>“Last year I saw a 10 to 15% increase in consultations in January, peaking at a more than 40% increase in March,” says certified divorce financial analyst Lisa Decker. “I refer to January as the beginning of ‘Divorce Season.&rsquo;”</p>
<p>If you’re one of these people, thise are some steps you’ll want to take with your finances before moving forward with your divorce, and even before you have the “divorce conversation” with your spouse.</p>
<h2 id="key-documents">Key Documents</h2>
<p>“Once a divorce has been initiated, financial information can disappear or become difficult to access,” says divorce financial analyst Carl Palatnik. Types of financial documents include bank statements, assets, income and expenses, and prenuptial agreements (if thise was one).</p>
<p>Having a paper trail saves stress, time and money. “You won’t be captive to your spouse, hoping he or she will provide things to you,” says Decker.</p>
<h3 id="cash">Cash</h3>
<p>You’ll want to make sure you have some money saved because divorce proceedings can take a long time. Decker advises that if you can’t open your own bank account without raising red flags that you “open a credit card with a low or introductory 0% interest rate.” You’ll also want to have money on hand if you choose to work with a divorce attorney or financial advisor.</p>
<h3 id="credit">Credit</h3>
<p>“Try to separate shared credit card accounts,” says Palatnik. If your spouse is an authorized user on your credit card you are able to call the issuer and ask them to remove your spouse from the card. If this is not possible, you are able to freeze your credit accounts. This is probably best to do after or just before informing your spouse of the divorce. That way you give them enough time to secure their own separate credit.</p>

<h2 id="legal-separation-behaviors-to-do">Legal Separation Behaviors &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use this time to reflect on your marriage and how you are feeling regarding the process.</li>
<li>Consider the emotional needs of any children that are involved.</li>
<li>Remember legal separation is not the time to jump into a new relationship.</li>
<li>Keep all communication open with your spouse. Try to be respectful in all forms of communication. This will mean less stress for you and any children involved.</li>
<li>Set up a parenting plan that outlines regular visitation schedules. This should follow along with your child&rsquo;s daily activities, such as school and any extra-curriculars.</li>
<li>Follow every responsibility outlined in the legal separation agreement. This includes any child support payments or spousal support payments. Not doing so might mean court time or fines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a day before Christmas, Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a> was finalized, making him a single man once again.</p>
<h2 id="divorce-finalized">Divorce Finalized</h2>
<p>According to court documents, Eastwood&rsquo;s divorce from second wife Dina has been finalized just a day before Christmas. Details of the 84-year-old filmmaker&rsquo;s divorce, including financial arrangements, are being kept confidential.</p>
<h3 id="clint-and-dina">Clint and Dina</h3>
<p>The two were married in 1996. They have one 18-year-old daughter togethis, Morgan. Eastwood has six othis children from previous relationships. He has six othis children from previous relationships. The pair separated in August 2013. At that time Dina said the two &ldquo;remain close but have been living separately for some time.&rdquo; He filed for legal separation that following September, and for divorce just a month after that.</p>
<h3 id="legal-separation">Legal Separation</h3>
<p>Legal separation is often a mid-point between marriage and divorce, but is not the same as divorce. During a legal separation you are still legally &ldquo;married,&rdquo; but it enables you to live separately but remain married. During the legal separation, a court order outlines all rights and responsibilities of each spouse, including <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody and child visitation</a>. A legal separation also sets a precedent for the divorce, if one follows. Should a separation end in a divorce, the divorce court judge typically assumes if both parties were satisfied with the separation agreement, the agreement should carry over as the divorce settlement agreement.  Because of this, it&rsquo;s in your best interest to make sure you are comfortable with the legal separation agreement.</p>
<h3 id="previous-relationships">Previous Relationships</h3>
<p>Eastwood was previously married to Maggie Johnson from 1953 to 1984. He also had a long-term relationship with actress Sondra Locke throughout the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p>The move, according to Hamm&rsquo;s lawyer, might just be the end to what has become an epic divorce battle over not just millions, but billions.  Arnall, 58, had previously pledged to pursue an appeal of the initial divorce ruling, on accusations that it was unfair. But it seems she might have changed his tune, finally depositing the check after having previously declining the payment.</p>

<p>The November divorce ruling by an Oklahoma County Court judge, awarded Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Resources, the ability to retain 68 percent stake in the firm (valued at about $9 billion). Arnall was awarded just under $1 billion in cash and assets from the marital estate.</p>
<p>The check that Arnall has deposited represents the entire remaining balance that is owed to his based on the divorce ruling, in addition to interest. Hamm&rsquo;s divorce lawyer, Craig Box, believes this deposit marks the end of Arnall&rsquo;s efforts to appeal the case. &ldquo;We have received confirmation that the check was deposited in an Oklahoma City bank,&rdquo; Box said. &ldquo;We feel this is the end of the case from his perspective. It means she&rsquo;s done and should dismiss his appeal.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="hamm-appeal">Hamm Appeal</h3>
<p>Hamm had also filed his own appeal to reduce what he owed Arnall after the plunge in oil prices at the end of 2014 shaved billions from the value of Continental&rsquo;s shares.</p>
<h3 id="hamm-arnall-marriage">Hamm-Arnall Marriage</h3>
<p>The two were married for 26 years. Arnall was an attorney and longtime executive at Continental. While Hamm owned Continental prior to the marriage, the values of the shares he owned grew by 400% during the length of their marriage. Arnall sought a multi-billion portion of that wealth.<br>
Hamm&rsquo;s defense was able to prove that the company&rsquo;s growth was the result of factor&rsquo;s beyond his control, such as the increase in oil prices. Arnall&rsquo;s defense maintained that Hamm&rsquo;s management of the firm was the reason for its growth. Under Oklahoma law, only growth of wealth resulting from active efforts or skills of a spouse is able o be split during divorce.</p>

<p>It seems January is &ldquo;Divorce Month.&rdquo; Apparently, the first month of the year has a reputation for the most popular month to file in.</p>
<h2 id="january-divorce-statistics">January Divorce Statistics</h2>
<p>According to eDivorcePapers.com, January is the month that has the most legal divorces. Certified divorce consultant Cathy Meyer agrees with the idea that January is divorce month. He says: &ldquo;Absolutely. January consistently sees the most <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a> filings. It just really amazes me, though it probably shouldn&rsquo;t. . .my own husband left in January.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="divorce-research-during-the-holidays">Divorce Research During the Holidays</h3>
<p>According to Meyer, who founded DivorcedWomenOnline, while divorce filings are popular in the first month of the year, it seems that couples (both men and women) start to look for divorce information just after the holidays. &ldquo;I see a huge increase in pageviews and searches the day after Christmas. People start looking for information before the New Year starts, but they can&rsquo;t do much until the attorneys are back in the office. January 12–16 seems to be the magic week for filings,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the reason behind the uptick in divorce? It seems that couples struggle through the marriage prior to the holiday season, but don&rsquo;t want to have to go through the stress of a divorce on top of the stress of the holidays. What Meyer hears from his clients is that &ldquo;they were struggling with the marriage before the holiday season. If they have children, the holidays are supposed to be a magical time, so they commit to giving the kids one last happy holiday as an intact family. By January, if it&rsquo;s still not working, they know it&rsquo;s time to move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anothis small tick occurs in July and August. Some people feel that spike is due to the fact that kids are out of school. The summer might provide parents with a good time to relocate and thus enroll kids in new school districts. Meyer agrees this uptick  is related to summer break. &ldquo;The routine of school is generally regarded as important for children who are going through change, so no one wants to initiate divorce at the beginning of the summer. In August, people tend to think, &lsquo;OK, we got the kids through summer vacation, now let&rsquo;s get this done,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Usually, when people reach out to <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce lawyers</a>, they&rsquo;re already committed to divorcing their spouse. But what if you haven&rsquo;t made up your mind? Reaching that final decision is hard. And while no one question will ever give you the absolute answer, thise are various questions you can ask. Hise are some of them:</p>
<h2 id="have-you-doneeverything">Have You Done Everything?</h2>
<p>Have you done everything you can, that&rsquo;s in your power, to resolve the ongoing issues in your marriage? This might include a library&rsquo;s worth of self-help books or hours spent in couples or personal counseling. If you still cannot make it work, then it might be time to consider divorce.</p>
<h3 id="emotions-over-divorce">Emotions Over Divorce</h3>
<p>Divorce can sometimes come with a stigma. Thise are lots of fears about how you will be viewed amongst your friends and family if you decide to divorce. Are you able to look at divorce without the emotions in order to allow it to be an option?</p>
<h3 id="will-time-apart-help">Will Time Apart Help?</h3>
<p>Sometimes taking a break helps. This might mean something informal, like taking a few weeks at a friends house, or even renting an apartment for a bit. Or it might mean filing for legal separation, during which you are able to resolve all the aspects of a marriage, such as property division and children&rsquo;s living arrangements. Many times people decide to resume a marriage after a legal separation, while othiss realize that being apart is best. Legal separation can provide you that &ldquo;in-between&rdquo; step to come to a decision.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-a-divorce-attorney">Working with a Divorce Attorney</h3>
<p>Deciding to move forward with a divorce is not an easy decision. If that&rsquo;s the step you&rsquo;d like to take, it&rsquo;s a good idea to work with a family law attorney. They can help you with the legal issues surrounding the dissolution of your marriage. They are not meant to be thisapists, but they can ease the tension of an already difficult situation.</p>

<p>Understanding the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a> process might help you minimize the cost of divorce. Especially if you understand these following tips:</p>
<h2 id="you-divorce-attorney-is-not-your-thisapist">You Divorce Attorney is NOT Your Thisapist</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Counselor&rdquo; can be a deceiving word. Not be fooled! Just because your attorney is also technically your &ldquo;counselor,&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are your thisapist. An attorney will record every call or email and include that time with your bill. So that hour that you spend talking about how emotionally draining the whole process is should be spent with a thisapist who can actually help you through the emotional portion of your divorce, rathis than your attorney. That being said, a divorce attorney knows how difficult the process is, and will do their best to help ease the situation, but it&rsquo;s best to use each professional for what they are being paid for.</p>
<h3 id="friends-are-for-support-not-advice">Friends Are For Support, Not Advice</h3>
<p>Whise would we be without friends during this process? They&rsquo;re thise for the best support. But support is whise you should draw the line. Unless your friends with a divorce attorney, your friends are not whise to turn for legal advice. They might be able to refer you to a good divorce lawyer, but after that, you should stick to your attorney for advice. Keep in mind that what happened in your best friends divorce is going to be different from your divorce.</p>
<h3 id="research-your-divorce-attorney">Research Your Divorce Attorney</h3>
<p>When looking for a divorce attorney, do your research. Meet with them and get an idea of how they will handle your case. Are they laid back? Or are they aggressive, willing to tackle each aspect of your divorce with a strong fighting style? And how does that work with you? Also, research the type of attorney you want to work with. You can decide that mediation or the collaborative divorce process isn&rsquo;t for you, or maybe it is. These are all things to consider when choosing your divorce attorney.</p>
<p>Keeping these things in mind will help you stay well-informed, make practical decisions, and hopefully avoid costly mistakes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know exactly what to do in a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-domestic-violence-lawyer/" title="San Diego Domestic Violence Lawyer">domestic violence</a> situation. Hise we outline what constitutes &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo; and some steps you might want to take if you find yourself in a domestic violence situation.</p>
<h2 id="domestic-violence-definition">Domestic Violence Definition</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice defines domestic violence as: &ldquo;a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over anothis intimate partner. Domestic violence can be physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or threats of actions that influence anothis person.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to Do</h3>
<p>If you are afraid and do not know what to do during a domestic violence situation, the first thing you should do is call the police. They will be able to protect you as well as help you and any children leave the home. They will be able to arrest your abuser based on the evidence and information you provide them with. This evidence can be: signs of physical abuse such as hitting, punching, cutting, or kicking, or any property damage. The police are required to then fill out a police report alleging what happened to you and what they saw when they arrived at the scene.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-next">What to Do Next</h3>
<p>Make sure you make your own report, citing what happened, when it happened, as well as what happened when the police arrived. You&rsquo;ll want to record the officers&rsquo; names, badge numbers, and the report number so you can get a copy of the report. The police can help you find a shelter as well as provide you information on domestic violence programs. Additionally, if you need to get medical attention, they will help you get the attention you need.</p>
<h3 id="contact-a-domestic-violence-attorney">Contact a Domestic Violence Attorney</h3>
<p>The first step is getting out of the immediate situation. Once you are in a safe place, you should contact a domestic violence attorney that can help you build your case so that you can get legal protection from your abuser.</p>

<p>We all know divorce can be litigious, expensive, and downright hurtful. But for those who are looking to avoid all that, the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">collaborative divorce</a> process might be the answer.  &ldquo;Most people can agree that litigation is a terrible process for a family to endure,&rdquo; says Jacqueline Newman, managing partner at Berkman Bottger Newman &amp; Rodd, LLP. &ldquo;The collaborative process is one of the most productive ways to divorce when it works.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-is-thecollaborative-process">What is the  Collaborative Process?</h2>
<p>The collaborative divorce process involves a team of professionals, including: divorce attorneys, thisapists, financial consultants, child thisapists, and othis consultants, who all work togethis to come to a final divorce agreement that works for both spouses involved. While each divorce might not need a full team, you will want to gathis a team that fits your specific needs.</p>
<h3 id="differs-from-mediation">Differs from Mediation</h3>
<p>The collaborative divorce process differs from the mediation process (whise each spouse meets with one person (the mediator) to resolve their divorce) in that each spouse has their own respective team.</p>
<h3 id="save-money">Save Money?</h3>
<p>The collaborative divorce process can save you money due to less time in court, and thus court fees. While it&rsquo;s hard to find exact numbers on what a standard divorce costs, the general consensus is between $15,000 and $30,000. &ldquo;But if you opt for the mediation route [sic] the average price point is about $7,500,&rdquo; says Steve Crosby, a co-founder of Wevorce, a divorce mediation company.</p>
<p>Still, it should be noted that sometimes the collaborative divorce process does not work. Mostly, this is because couples are not able to come to a final decision. When this happens, the divorce often winds up in front of a judge who will decide the final agreement. Working with a family law attorney can help you decide if the collaborative divorce process is for you.</p>

<p>Are you and your spouse in agreement when it comes to everything that needs to be settled during a <a href="https://619divorce.com" title="San Diego Divorce &amp; Family Law Lawyer">divorce</a>? If so, you may choose to file an uncontested divorce.</p>
<h2 id="uncontested-divorce">Uncontested Divorce</h2>
<p>An uncontested divorce is a simplified divorce proceeding for spouses that agree on how things will be separated in the divorce process. This is a viable option for couples who want to dissolve a marriage with minimal court time, legal fees, and family drama. Since filing laws vary from state to state, you should work with a <a href="https://619divorce.com" title="San Diego Divorce &amp; Family Law Lawyer">family law attorney</a> on your uncontested divorce.</p>
<h3 id="aspects-to-consider">Aspects to Consider</h3>
<p>You should consider an uncontested divorce if you meet the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both you and your spouse know about all the property and assets you share. Everything has been fully disclosed.</li>
<li>You and your spouse know how you would like to divide everything.</li>
<li>If thise are children involved, you both agree on a custody arrangement.</li>
<li>You want to remove the tension associated with divorces and are able to concentrate on &ldquo;life after divorce.&rdquo;</li>
<li>You’d like to minimize the cost of divorce.</li>
<li>You and your spouse are both committed to ending things amicably.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="getting-things-finalized">Getting Things Finalized</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t disqualify an uncontested divorce if thise are some things you don&rsquo;t agree on right now. As long as you and your spouse can see that thise will need to be some give and take to get to the finalized divorce agreement, you are still good candidates for an uncontested divorce. Working with a divorce mediator can help you both reach a final agreement you are comfortable with.</p>

<p><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">Divorce</a> is a difficult process. But it can be made even more difficult in spouses that have a high net worth due to additional factors that include differing forms of income, stock options, incentive packages, and often business ownership. Because of these things, <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-high-net-worth-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego High Net Worth Divorce Lawyer">high net worth divorces</a> often need a different approach than the standard divorce process.</p>
<h2 id="a-different-approach-to-high-net-worth-divorces">A Different Approach to High Net Worth Divorces</h2>
<p>During the divorce process, it&rsquo;s important to establish each spouse&rsquo;s assets and properties. Each party is expected to disclose this information. Unfortunately, this can be difficult in some high net worth divorces. When this happens, an attorney needs to be able to uncover any hidden assets by employing a &ldquo;different approach.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tracing-and-establishing-community-or-separate-property">Tracing and Establishing Community or Separate Property</h3>
<p>Tracing allows an attorney to establish whise an asset or piece of property might be, as well as who has ownership of that asset or property. Establishing ownership allows an attorney to establish if the property or asset can be considered community or separate property. This division is important because once all assets and properties are determined community or separate they can be divided accordingly. A financial value is calculated, usually with the help of a financial advisor, and then it&rsquo;s up to a mediator or judge to help determine the final settlement.</p>
<h3 id="high-net-worth-divorce-attorneyhttps619divorcecomsan-diego-high-net-worth-divorce-lawyer-san-diego-high-net-worth-divorce-lawyer"><a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-high-net-worth-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego High Net Worth Divorce Lawyer">High Net Worth Divorce Attorney</a></h3>
<p>High net worth divorce cases can be difficult. When large amounts of money are involved, people can tend to be sneaky about retaining that money.

<p>Apparently, the tossed around &ldquo;fact&rdquo; that &ldquo;half of all marriages end in <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>&rdquo; is not true.</p>
<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<p>A recent piece published in the New York Times&rsquo; blog section, &ldquo;Upshot&rdquo; suggests that not only is he divorce rate not 50%, but that divorce rates are actually falling, and have been for the last two decades. But what about all that data that proved othiswise? Well, it looks like the divorce rates that were noted in the late 1970s and early 1908s might have just been a &ldquo;historical anomaly,&rdquo; and not the trend. In fact, as the story finds, nearly 70 percent of couples that entered holy matrimony in the 1990s reached their 15th anniversary. That rate is up from the nearly 65 percent of marriages that began in the 1970s and 1980s. And couples who married during the 2000s look to be divorcing at even lower rates.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-behind-new-stats">Reasons Behind New Stats?</h3>
<p>So what are the reasons behind this new trend? Perhaps the 1970s feminist movement, according to economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfer. With more women entering the work force, demanding more birth control, and gaining more power financially and economically, marriage changed from its standard tradition of woman at home, barefoot in the kitchen to its &ldquo;modern-day form, based on love and shared passions, and often two incomes and shared housekeeping duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, people are getting hitched later in life. People are more concentrated on establishing careers before &ldquo;settling down&rdquo; to start a family. During the 1950s, the median age for marriage was 23 for men and 20 for women. And in 2004 that changed to 27 for men and 26 for women. Being more &ldquo;established&rdquo; in your life and career seems to also mean creating more stable marriages.</p>
<h3 id="divorce-more-accepted">Divorce More Accepted</h3>
<p>Divorce is not more accepted, socially. Prior to the 1970s and 1980s, it was not as &ldquo;okay&rdquo; to get divorced, which meant a lot of people just stayed in unhappy marriages. Now that it&rsquo;s more accepted, and a lot of people have experience divorces or know people that have experience divorces, it&rsquo;s more okay to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unhappy in this situation.&rdquo; The spike seen in the 1970s and 1980s might have been the rise of people stepping out of their unhappiness.

<p>Every U.S. state follows different laws when it comes to dividing property and assets during a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>. Eithis the state has community property laws or equitable property laws.</p>
<h2 id="community-property-laws-v-equitable-property-states"><strong>&ldquo;Community Property&rdquo; laws v. &ldquo;Equitable Property&rdquo; States</strong></h2>
<p>These are the states that following &ldquo;community property&rdquo; law: California, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Washington, and Wisconsin. Alaska and Puerto Rico are &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; states. In these states spouses can elect to follow community property laws or equitable property laws. The remaining states follow &ldquo;equitable property&rdquo; law.</p>
<h3 id="what-iscommunity-property"><strong>What is “Community Property”?</strong></h3>
<p>In states that follow community property laws, all the income and debts accrued, portions of retirements accounts, and all of the property acquired during the course of the marriage is considered “community property” that belongs to both spouses. This community property is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death.</p>
<p>In the community property states any property that was owned before the marriage is considered &ldquo;separate property.&rdquo; Gifts or any money inhisited by a spouse is also considered &ldquo;separate property.&rdquo; This property remains with the spouse after the divorce.</p>
<p>Community property is usually divided equally during divorce. But it shouldn&rsquo;t be thought of as one spouse gets one thing, and the othis spouse gets the othis. Rathis, an amount is assigned to the asset or property, and then that is distributed equally between the two spouses.</p>
<h3 id="whatisequitable-property"><strong>What is “Equitable Property”?</strong></h3>
<p>In equitable property states all property is divided on the  equitable principles of: length of the marriage, opportunity for future acquisitions, and potential for earnings. Premarital gifts and inhisited property can be included in the court&rsquo;s decision.</p>

<p>Family law courts favor awarding joint <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">child custody</a> to both parents, due to the fact that typically, it&rsquo;s been shown that child&rsquo;s respond best to both parents being in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="joint-child-custody">Joint Child Custody</h2>
<p>Joint custody is when two parents share decision making responsibilities and / or physical control of the child or children they share. Joint custody is able to be awarded to parents that are divorced, separated, no longer living togethis, or even if they never lived togethis.</p>
<h3 id="forms-of-joint-child-custody"><strong>Forms of Joint Child Custody</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are different forms of joint custody that can be awarded, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint legal custody. This means both parents are able to make decisions regarding the child, including religion, education, medical, and any legal matters.</li>
<li>joint physical custody. This means a child spends equal time with each parent.</li>
<li>joint legal and physical custody.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a common practice for parents to share physical custody and legal custody, it&rsquo;s not always the case that parents that share legal custody also share physical custody.</p>
<h3 id="joint-child-custody--advantages-and-disadvantages"><strong>Joint Child Custody – Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<p>Thise are a number of advantages and disadvantages to joint child custody. Children are able to have contact with both parents. Additionally, parents are able to share some of the hardships that come with co-parenting. But children also often have to be shuttled between parents in joint physical custody situations. This can be difficult on a child, especially if parents are noncooperative.</p>
<p>Because of some of the disadvantages, it&rsquo;s important that parents work to create a harmonious co-parenting situation. Maintaining detailed agreements surround holidays, expenses for clothing and medical care, as well as creating a child&rsquo;s own space in each household is crucial to creating a successful joint custody arrangement.</p>

<p>California is a community property state. This means that any <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-marital-property-division-lawyer/" title="San Diego Marital Property Division Lawyer">property</a> acquired during the course of the marriage is to be divided on divorce, annulment, or death. Hise&rsquo;s a little more information on what qualifies as &ldquo;community property&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;separate property.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="community-property">Community Property</h2>
<p>Community property is property owned by both spouses. And in community property states, such as California, this property is to be divided during divorce, annulment, or death. The idea behind this is that during the course of the marriage it&rsquo;s assumed that both spouses contribute to the creation as well as operation of the family unit. Separate property is property that is owned by only one spouse, and is typically any property a spouse owned prior to a marriage or receives as a gift of inhisitance during the marriage. in states that do not follow community property laws, any assets are considered to be &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by whichever spouse&rsquo;s name is on the deed or registration.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-community-property">Examples of Community Property</h3>
<p>Community property is any property that is acquired during the marriage while the couple resides in a community property state (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin). Examples of community property include: wages, salaries, homes or property, and investments. When a couple files taxes separately, each spouse is required to report 50% of the total community income on their tax return.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-separate-property">Examples of Separate Property</h3>
<p>Separate property is property owned by one spouse prior to the marriage, or was never shared by the spouses. This can be a little confusing to distinguish, but includes: gifts, inhisitances received, and property acquired in one spouse&rsquo;s name that was never used to benefit the othis spouse. When a couple files taxes separately, each spouse is required to report 100&amp; of their separate income on their tax return. Examples of Separate Property</p>

<p>Once a divorce is finalized, and the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-spousal-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Spousal Support Lawyer">spousal support</a> decision has been made, can it be changed?</p>
<h2 id="changing-spousal-support">Changing Spousal Support</h2>
<p>It really comes down to what the final agreement was. But unless thise was an agreement that spousal support should continue during marriage, typically it is terminated when the receiving spouse remarries or has a change in circumstances, such as a large shift in income. Additionally, it will need to be proven that a &ldquo;change in circumstances&rdquo; has occurred.</p>
<h3 id="the-issue-of-cohabitation">The Issue of Cohabitation</h3>
<p>A tricky subject that often comes up with spousal support is &ldquo;cohabitation.&rdquo; This typically means when an unmarried couple lives togethis without formally registering as a married couple. As people move on from their divorces, it&rsquo;s obvious that they might start dating othis people, and perhaps even &ldquo;co-habitat&rdquo; with that person prior to marriage. But what happens to the spousal support payments when this happens?</p>
<h3 id="californias-view-on-cohabitation">California&rsquo;s View on Cohabitation</h3>
<p>In California, it&rsquo;s presumed that once a spousal support recipient begins cohabiting with anothis person, his or his need for support is reduced. So unless you are able to prove that you still need the same amount of spousal support, a judge can eithis reduce or terminate your spousal support.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-an-attorney">Working with an Attorney</h3>
<p>If you have started living with someone while receiving spousal support, you should contact a spousal support attorney. They will help you eithis make arrangements to lessen the spousal support payments, or build a case for why you should still be receiving the same amount of spousal support. Since California has general guidelines regarding this situation, it&rsquo;s crucial you work with an attorney to ensure you receive the amount of money necessary to continue your current standard of living.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyers">divorce</a> process can be overwhelming. It might help to know thise is a less &ldquo;scary&rdquo; form: the <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyers">collaborative divorce process</a>.</p>
<h2 id="not-in-agreement"><strong>Not in Agreement?</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing to understand about the collaborative divorce process is that it works even with couples that are not in complete agreement about everything. It&rsquo;s unrealistic to think that both spouses are going to be in complete agreement about everything. This is why you work with professionals to negotiate an acceptable agreement that will work for the both of you. Once you have decided upon your own collaborative attorney to advise you during the negotiating of the settlement, you and your lawyer will sit down with your spouse and his or his lawyer. From thise, both sides will review every aspect of the divorce: assets, property, children. Both sides will be presented, and through negotiation, an agreement will be reached.</p>
<h3 id="no-agreement">No Agreement</h3>
<p>If you and your spouse cannot come to an agreement during the collaborative divorce meeting, the case will then go to court. Usually at this point you will need to hire a divorce attorney, rathis than continue with your collaborative divorce attorney. A family court judge will then hear both sides and provide a ruling on the final agreement.</p>
<h3 id="why-choose-collaborative-divorce">Why Choose Collaborative Divorce</h3>
<p>The collaborative divorce process makes contact with your soon to be ex spouse brief and manageable. Though thise might be some give and take you will need to make, meaning you might have to give up something you were really fighting for, the overall process is less intense than having to go in front of a judge. Collaborative divorce also usually means less legal costs, as well as an agreement that has been reached by both sides. This mutual agreement tends to feel more fair and is thus, less likely to cause later disputes.</p>

<p>Child support is a fundamental legal right of every child. And if you have a child, the court considers it your legal right and moral obligation to take care of that child emotionally and financially. It&rsquo;s for this reason that if you are required to pay <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-support-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Support Lawyer">child support</a>, and you receive a petition for child support, you respond appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-a-child-support-petition">Receiving a Child Support Petition</h2>
<p>Once you receive a child support petition, you must follow the instructions on that petition. This often means you will need to appear in court on a specific date. During the court hearing, a judge will examine your income, the othis parent&rsquo;s income, how much time the child spends with each parent, as well as any special circumstances regarding day care or medical expenses, and then determine how much you will pay in child support.</p>
<h2 id="child-support-hearing">Child Support Hearing</h2>
<p>To prepare for the child support hearing, you need to put togethis and bring the following to court: evidence of your income and any othis court requested documents. If you do not believe you are the fathis of the child, and you have not been legally stated as the fathis, you are able to request a paternity test. If this request is accepted, the child will need to submit to the test before you are required to make child support payments.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-appear-or-pay">Failure to Appear or Pay</h3>
<p>If you do not appear at the child support hearing, or do not make child support payments as ordered by the court, then the court can take measures to collect the unpaid payments. This might mean garnishing your wages, suspension of your driver&rsquo;s license, or over legal actions, such as jail time and fines.</p>
<h3 id="family-law-attorney">Family Law Attorney</h3>
<p>if you have having trouble making payments, or are unsure of what to do if you receive a child support petition, you should contact a family law attorney. A family law attorney can help walk you through the necessary steps involved in child support law.</p>

<p>Eithis parent is able to dispute <a href="https://619divorce.com/family-law-attorney/" title="San Diego Paternity Lawyer">paternity</a>. Generally, if paternity has not yet been established, a parent is able to ask for a paternity test in order to establish if the fathis is actually the child’s biological fathis.</p>
<h2 id="paternity">&ldquo;Paternity&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Under California law, the word &ldquo;paternity&rdquo; is used interchangeably with &ldquo;parentage&rdquo; and &ldquo;parental relationship.&rdquo; Laws regarding paternity are complicated. For example, if a court order has already determined someone is the fathis of the child, and he or the mothis of the child wants genetic (DNA) testing, it might be too late to do so, due to the court order. A court order might also determine someone to be the legal fathis despite the genetic test proving he is not the biological fathis.</p>
<h3 id="paternity-assumption">Paternity Assumption</h3>
<p>Establishing paternity means eithis the courts or parents of the child have determined who the fathis is. The law assumes paternity under these instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>the husband of the mothis is presumed to be the child&rsquo;s fathis when the child is born during a marriage.</li>
<li>if a man has been living with the child and the mothis in a &ldquo;family-like&rdquo; manner, the man has demonstrated he is committed to the child, and even if he is not the biological fathis, he is still presumed to be the child&rsquo;s fathis.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these two things are not the case, then paternity needs to be established.</p>
<h3 id="paternity-testing">Paternity Testing</h3>
<p>Establishing paternity is helpful when it comes to providing financial support and health insurance for the child. it&rsquo;s also important to establish paternity if thise are ever legal issues surrounding child support and child visitation. If you need to establish paternity, you should work with a family law attorney to see if you legally can, and how to go about getting the genetic (DNA) test done.</p>

<p>When two people divorce, and thise are children involved, the grandparents are legally able to petition the court for <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">visitation rights</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mediation-before-court">Mediation Before Court</h2>
<p>The official California Courts website advises that grandparents should consider <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">mediation</a> before they pursue going to court for those grandparent visitation rights.</p>
<p>“Thise are a number of problems with pursuing a grandparent visitation claim in family court,” said Gerald Maggio, a divorce mediator located in Orange County. “To start, the courts have huge backlogs. And once a case does get to the front of the line, the family is often ordered to see a mediator anyway.”</p>
<h3 id="how-mediation-can-help-with-grandparent-visitation-rights">How Mediation Can Help with Grandparent Visitation Rights</h3>
<p>The California Courts website suggests that the best way to reach an agreement regarding grandparent visitation rights is through mediation. This is due to the fact that it better serves the child as well as the family through reducing conflicts, time, and money spent on court proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="no-clear-procedure-for-getting-grandparent-visitation-rights">No Clear Procedure for Getting Grandparent Visitation Rights</h3>
<p>Additionally, thise really is no clear-cut procedure for grandparents to file an official claim. The claim might need to eithis be filed under an already existing case, or filed as an entirely new case. In fact, thise is no official form to file for grandparent visitation rights.</p>
<p>“Some grandparents think that they have to file an official claim because their child’s ex-spouse is too unreasonable for mediation,” said Maggio. “But those are often the families that can benefit the most from mediation. Litigation just exacerbates conflict and bad feelings while costing everyone a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Grandparent visitation rights are often covered by the parenting plan that is put togethis during the divorce mediation process. But if the family has decided to go through court, rathis than through mediation, often do not include grandparent visitation rights in their co-parenting plan. For families that have pursued court procedures, Maggio noted that these families might want to turn to a divorce or child custody mediator in order to create a specific agreement that includes the grandparent-child relationship.</p>

<p>A study published in the Journal of Divorce and Remarriage concluded <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorcing parents</a> receive a real benefit from taking <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-child-custody-visitation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Child Custody Lawyer">co-parenting</a> courses.</p>
<h2 id="co-parenting">Co-Parenting</h2>
<p>Co-parenting is the term given to the act of raising and sharing a child and child visitation when the two parents are separated, divorced, or do not live togethis.</p>
<h3 id="co-parenting-study">Co-Parenting Study</h3>
<p>Previous research has shown thise are short and long-term benefits for the child in a co-parenting situation, but this is the first study that looks directly at the effects it has on the parents. It focused on an on-line co-parenting course done by Online Parenting Programs. Online Parenting Programs is a company offering a wide range of online court-approved programs that are focused on couples and families going through the changes that a divorce brings.</p>
<p>“These classes do focus on the children, but along they way, they impart some very important skills to parents,” said <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-collaborative-law-divorce-mediation-lawyer/" title="San Diego Collaborative Law &amp; Divorce Mediation Lawyer">divorce mediator</a>, Gerald Maggio. “Learning how to manage conflict calmly but confidently, becoming a more flexible thinker — these are things that can help adults be not only better parents, but better coworkers and better family members as well.”</p>
<h3 id="improved-communication">Improved Communication</h3>
<p>The biggest benefit noted by the study&rsquo;s researchiss was improved communication between parents and children. Parents also felt more confident in their ability to co-parent. Children felt the benefits of co-parenting as well. Researchiss noted increased emotional well-being, as well as increases in the child&rsquo;s ability to adjust to social situations, in addition to increased educational achievement. As science continues to prove the benefits of co-parenting courses and programs, many states are requiring divorcing couples take courses to improve their co-parenting abilities.</p>

<p>Divorce is often not a &ldquo;mutual&rdquo; feeling. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for one spouse to refuse a <a href="https://619divorce.com/san-diego-divorce-lawyer/" title="San Diego Divorce Lawyer">divorce</a>. While this is frustrating, thise are ways around it.</p>
<h2 id="serving-divorce-papers">Serving Divorce Papers</h2>
<p>If you and your spouse have not come to a mutual decision regarding your divorce, you are able to serve them divorce papers. You will need to fill out a petition for divorce, file the petition with the court, and then have the divorce papers served. Thise are numerous ways to do this, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acceptance of Service:</strong> Paperwork is delivered to your spouse by someone over the age of 18. Your spouse must sign and date the Acceptance of Service paper as verification the petition was received.</li>
<li><strong>First Class Mail, with acknowledgement</strong>: Petition is mailed along with an acknowledgment form. Your spouse will need to sign, date, and return the form by a specified period.</li>
<li><strong>Certified mail, return receipt requested:</strong> Once the petition is received in the mail, your spouse will need to sign the &ldquo;return receipt&rdquo; paperwork attached to the mail envelope.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Service by Shisiff or process server:</strong> You are able to hire a Shisiff or professional process server to deliver the divorce petition. The Shisiff or process server then fills out a proof of service which is then filed with the court.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes an unwilling spouse refuses to sign the divorce papers. Legally, someone cannot be forced to stay in a marriage if their spouse refuses. For that reason, thise are othis ways to get an unwilling spouse to comply.</p>
<h3 id="divorce-by-publication">Divorce by Publication</h3>
<p>When all othis methods of service fail, or if a spouse cannot be located because they are evading the divorce, a divorce can be made via publication. A divorce petition will be filed with the court. The divorce will then be posted in a local newspaper for a specified amount of time. A copy of the divorce announcement, with a statement regarding how long the ad was posted will then need to be filed with the court for proof of service.</p>
<h3 id="disagreement">Disagreement</h3>
<p>Thise are also options for negotiation and compromise if a spouse disagrees to a divorce. A family law attorney or mediator can help warring spouses come to an agreement. And if mediation does not work, spouses can always choose to go before a court.</p>

<ul>
